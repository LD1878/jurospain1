### 🛡️ The Juro Strategy

**The "6-Month" Guillotine**
The "Beckham Law" allows new residents to pay a flat 24% tax on income up to €600k, rather than the standard progressive rate which hits 47%. However, the application (Model 149) is unforgiving. If filed one day past the 6-month anniversary of your arrival, you are locked into the standard tax system for 5 years. This client came to us dangerously close to the cutoff.

**The Fix: Proof of Fiscal Residency**
The Tax Office (Hacienda) often disputes the "Arrival Date." Was it when he rented the Airbnb? Or when he started working?
We bypassed the ambiguity by filing an urgent administrative request linking his start date strictly to his **Social Security registration**, which was later than his physical arrival. This bought us the critical extra days needed to keep his application inside the legal window.

**The Result: Massive Savings**
We secured the approval just 8 days before the deadline.
* **Without Juro:** He would have paid approx. €58,000/year in tax.
* **With Juro:** He pays approx. €26,000/year.
* **Total Savings:** Over **€160,000** during the 5-year duration of the regime.
