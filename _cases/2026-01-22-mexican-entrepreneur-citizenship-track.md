### 🛡️ The Juro Strategy

**The "Continuous Residency" Trap**
Citizens of Ibero-American countries (Mexico, Argentina, etc.) are eligible for Spanish citizenship after just **two years** of legal residency. However, there is a catch: you cannot be absent from Spain for more than 3 months consecutively during that period. The client traveled frequently for business and risked breaking this chain.

**The Fix: The "Golden" Buffer**
We advised the client to opt for the **Golden Visa** (via a €500k real estate purchase) rather than a Non-Lucrative Visa.
Why? The Golden Visa does not require you to become a *Tax Resident* to renew the visa itself. However, to get *Citizenship*, physical presence is required. We created a strict "Travel Calendar" for the client, ensuring his trips to Mexico never exceeded 89 days, preserving his continuity for the Ministry of Justice while maintaining his business interests abroad.

**The Result**
He successfully completed his two years of residency in January 2026. We immediately filed his Citizenship application (Expediente de Nacionalidad) electronically. He is now on track to receive a full EU Passport, granting him visa-free access to the entire Schengen zone and the right to live anywhere in Europe.
