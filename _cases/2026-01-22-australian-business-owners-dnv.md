### 🛡️ The Juro Strategy

**The "Director" vs. "Employee" Hurdle**
For this couple moving from Sydney to Barcelona, the main obstacle was their status. They paid themselves a salary, but because they owned >25% of the company, Spanish Immigration (UGE) views this as a "Professional Relationship," not an employment one. Filing as standard employees would have led to an immediate denial (Denegado).

**The Fix: The "Autónomo" Commitment**
Since there is a gap in the Social Security agreement for this specific profile, we structured their application to include a formal commitment to register as *Autónomo* (Freelancer/Self-Employed) in Spain upon approval.
1.  **Proof of Activity:** We compiled 12 months of Australian BAS (Business Activity Statements) and client contracts to prove the company was not a "shell" created just for the visa.
2.  **The "Remote" Argument:** We drafted a specific Board Resolution from their own company authorizing their remote work, explicitly stating that their physical presence in Sydney was not required for day-to-day operations—crucial for directors.

**The Result: Family Synchronization**
The application included both children (ages 6 and 9). By filing electronically through Madrid, we secured the approval in **20 business days**. This timing was critical: it allowed them to secure "NIE" numbers for the children in time for the March school enrollment period in Barcelona, ensuring the kids didn't miss a term.
