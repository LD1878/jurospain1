### 🛡️ The Juro Strategy

**The "Unbankable" Millionaire**
Spain is conservative. When a Compliance Officer at a bank sees incoming transfers from "Adult Content Platforms" or "Crypto Exchanges," they often freeze the account immediately. This client was a top-tier creator from LA who had already been rejected by BBVA and Santander. They had the money, but on paper, they looked like a "High-Risk" liability.

**The Fix: Corporate Legitimacy**
We stopped the client from applying as an "Individual."
1.  **The "Production Company" Wrapper:** We advised the client to route income through their existing US LLC, rebranding their activity from "Model" to "Digital Media Production & Licensing."
2.  **The "Private Bank" Route:** Instead of walking into a high-street branch, we utilized our network with a specific **Private Wealth division** in Madrid that understands the Creator Economy. We prepared a "Source of Funds" dossier (showing platform payouts vs. tax returns) to satisfy the AML officers *before* the application was submitted.

**The Result**
We secured a fully operational Spanish IBAN within 10 days. With the banking hurdle cleared, we filed the Digital Nomad Visa application portraying the client as a **Media Executive** managing their own brand. The UGE-CE approved the 3-year residency without a single question regarding the nature of the content.
