### 🛡️ The Juro Strategy

**The "Income vs. Savings" Problem**
Since Brexit, the scrutiny on British Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) applications has intensified. This couple wished to retire to the Costa Blanca but lacked a state pension (they were 55 and 58). They relied entirely on savings from a house sale. The Spanish Consulate in London is notorious for preferring "passive income" (monthly dividends/rent) over "lump sums," viewing cash as unstable.

**The Fix: The "12-Month Average" Certificate**
We advised the client *not* to simply show a bank balance. Instead, we worked with their UK bank to produce a specific **Average Balance Certificate** showing the funds had been stable for 12 months.
Additionally, we utilized the **S1 Healthcare Form** strategy. Although they weren't pension age, one partner had a medical exemption allowing early access to the S1. This saved them €1,800/year in private health insurance costs—a requirement usually mandatory for NLV applicants.

**The Result**
Despite the consulate initially querying their lack of monthly income flows, our legal cover letter citing *Article 47* (regarding sufficient economic means via asset ownership) settled the matter. They are now residents in Javea, Alicante.
