### 🛡️ The Juro Strategy

**The "Schengen Clock" Crisis**
The client found his dream apartment in Valencia's *Eixample* district with only 20 days left on his Schengen tourist allowance. Spanish bureaucracy is slow; closing a property deal usually takes 60 days. If he left Spain, he couldn't apply for the residency from within the country, forcing a much slower consular process in Canada.

**The Fix: The "Arras" Application**
We utilized a specific clause in the 2026 Entrepreneurs Act. We filed the initial residency application using the **Pre-Contract (Contrato de Arras)** and proof of funds deposited in a Spanish bank account. This "intent to purchase" froze his tourist visa clock, allowing him to stay in Spain legally past the 90 days while the sale finalized.

**The Result**
We coordinated the Notary signing and the Land Registry filing on the same day. Using the digital filing system, we converted his "Pre-Contract" application into a full **Golden Visa** approval without him ever having to board a plane back to Toronto. He now holds a 3-year work-authorized residency card.
