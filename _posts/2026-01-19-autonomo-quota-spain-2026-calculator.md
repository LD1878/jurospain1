faqs:
  - question: "Is the Flat Rate (Tarifa Plana) still €80 in 2026?"
    answer: "Technically, the base is €80, but with the new 'Intergenerational Equity Mechanism' (MEI) surcharge of 0.9%, the actual amount withdrawn from your bank account will be approximately **€88.64** per month."
  - question: "Do I have to pay the full quota if I earn more than €6,000/month?"
    answer: "Yes and No. If you are on the Flat Rate (Year 1), you pay €88.64 regardless of income. Once the Flat Rate ends (Year 2), if you earn >€6,000 net/month, your mandatory minimum quota jumps to approximately **€593/month**."
  - question: "Which regions offer the 'Cuota Cero' (Zero Quota) in 2026?"
    answer: "Madrid and Andalusia remain the leaders. They will reimburse 100% of your social security costs for Year 1. Other regions like Murcia have ended or restricted their programs. Check your specific 'Comunidad Autónoma' before registering."
  - question: "Does paying more Social Security help me get a mortgage?"
    answer: "Yes. Spanish banks look at your 'Base de Cotización' to determine your stability. If you pay the minimum quota, the bank sees you as a 'low earner' even if your invoices are high. Paying a higher quota can unlock better financing."

If you are moving to Spain as a freelancer (or a "Contractor" using the Digital Nomad Visa), you have probably heard the magic number: **€80.**

*"Don't worry,"* the forums say. *"You just pay €80 a month for social security."*

In 2026, this advice is dangerous half-truth.

The Spanish Social Security system (*Seguridad Social*) has fully transitioned to the **"Real Income"** model (*Cotización por Ingresos Reales*).

For high-earning digital nomads, the days of cheap coverage are numbered. Here is the exact financial breakdown for your business plan this year.

## Phase 1: The "Honeymoon" (Year 1)

If this is your first time registering as an Autónomo in Spain, you qualify for the **Tarifa Plana** (Flat Rate).

However, in 2026, it is no longer exactly €80.
The government has increased the **MEI** (*Mecanismo de Equidad Intergeneracional*)—a tax to pay for boomer pensions—to **0.9%**.

* **Base Rate:** €80.00
* **MEI Surcharge:** +€8.64 (approx)
* **Total Monthly Cost:** **~€88.64**

**The "Cuota Cero" Bonus:**
If you register in **Madrid** or **Andalusia**, keep your receipts. These regional governments subsidize this cost 100%. You pay the €88.64 monthly, and at the end of the year, you apply for a full refund (approx €1,060).

## Phase 2: The "Reality Check" (Year 2 onwards)

This is where nomads get blindsided.

The Tarifa Plana *can* be extended to Year 2, **BUT only if your net income is below the SMI** (Minimum Wage, approx €1,323/month).

If you are a tech worker earning €50k, €80k, or €120k, **you will lose the Flat Rate on Day 1 of Year 2.**

You will fall into the "General Regime," where your fee is based on your **Net Monthly Income** (Invoices minus Deductible Expenses).

### The 2026 High-Earner Brackets

If you net more than **€6,000/month**, you are in the top bracket (Tramo 12).
Here is your new bill:

| Net Income | Minimum Base | **Monthly Quota (What you pay)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| €1,700 - €1,850 | €
