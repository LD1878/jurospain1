In a historic move on January 27, 2026, the Spanish Council of Ministers authorized an extraordinary regularisation process that will grant legal residency and work permits to an estimated **500,000 undocumented people** currently living in Spain. 

Unlike standard "Arraigo" (roots) pathways that usually require 2 or 3 years of residency, this 2026 Royal Decree is a limited-time "amnesty" designed to integrate workers into the formal economy. If you were in Spain before the end of 2025, you likely qualify.

## Core eligibility requirements

To benefit from this extraordinary regularisation, applicants must meet three non-negotiable criteria:

1.  **Presence in Spain:** You must prove you were already living in Spain (or had filed an asylum claim) before **December 31, 2025**.
2.  **Clean Criminal Record:** You must provide certificates showing no serious criminal record in Spain or your country of origin for the last 5 years.
3.  **No EU Citizenship:** This process is specifically for non-EU/EEA/Swiss nationals.

## The 5-month residency rule

The 2026 decree requires a very short period of "continued residency." At the moment you apply, you must be able to prove at least **five months of continuous presence** in Spain prior to the December 31, 2025 cutoff.

The most accepted proof is the **Empadronamiento** (census registration), but other "official traces" such as medical records, school enrollments for children, or previous asylum application receipts (even if denied) are valid.

## Application window and deadlines

The process follows a strict timeline:
* **Early April 2026:** Online application portals are expected to open.
* **June 30, 2026:** The application window is scheduled to close.

This is a **one-time window**. Missing the June deadline means you must revert to the standard (and much slower) Arraigo procedures.

## What the new permit allows

The permit granted through this process is highly flexible:
* **Duration:** Initially valid for **1 year**.
* **Work Authorization:** It allows you to work "cuenta ajena" (for an employer) or "autónomo" (self-employed) in any sector and any province in Spain.
* **Renewal:** After the first year, it can be modified into a standard 4-year residence-and-work permit.

## Difference between this and Arraigo Social

Many are confused between this decree and the standard Immigration Regulations.

* **Arraigo Social:** Requires 2 years of residency and a work contract. It is a permanent part of the law.
* **2026 Regularisation:** Requires only 5 months of residency and is a **temporary emergency measure**.

## FAQs

**Can I apply if my asylum was denied?**
Yes. The decree specifically includes people with denied asylum as long as they were in Spain before Dec 31, 2025.

**Do I need a job contract to apply?**
No. Unlike standard Arraigo, this initial permit is granted based on residency and lack of criminal records, allowing you to seek work *after* it is granted.
