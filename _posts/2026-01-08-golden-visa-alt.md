  - question: "Is the Spanish Golden Visa still available in 2026?"
    answer: "The real estate investment route of the Golden Visa was officially phased out in 2025. Investors must now look toward business-based residency, the Digital Nomad Visa, or the Non-Lucrative Visa to gain Spanish residency."
  - question: "What is the best alternative to the Golden Visa for retirees?"
    answer: "The Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) remains the primary path for retirees. It requires proof of significant passive income or savings but does not allow the applicant to work for any Spanish or international entity."
  - question: "Can I still get residency by buying a house in Spain?"
    answer: "No, as of the 2025 legislative changes, purchasing property for €500,000 no longer grants automatic residency rights. You must qualify under different criteria such as remote work or business innovation."

## What replaced the Spanish Golden Visa in 2026?

As of 2026, the traditional Golden Visa based on property investment is no longer an option. Expats must now use "Active Residency" paths like the Digital Nomad Visa or "Passive Residency" paths like the Non-Lucrative Visa. For those with significant capital, the Business Entrepreneur Visa remains the only investment-adjacent route available.

## Comparison of 2026 Residency Alternatives

| Residency Type | Best For | Work Rights | Key Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Digital Nomad Visa** | Remote workers | Yes (Remote) | €2,520+ monthly income |
| **Non-Lucrative Visa** | Retirees | No | €28,800+ in annual savings |
| **Entrepreneur Visa** | Business owners | Yes (Own Business) | Innovative business plan |
| **Self-Employed Visa** | Freelancers | Yes (Local/Global) | Local business viability |

## The Entrepreneur Visa: The New Choice for High-Net-Worth Individuals

For those who previously looked at the Golden Visa, the Entrepreneur Visa is the closest remaining match. This permit is designed for individuals starting a business project in Spain that is considered "innovative" or of "special economic interest."

In our 15 years of handling residency audits, we have found that the definition of "innovative" has broadened. The Spanish authorities now prioritize projects that create local jobs or advance green technology. Unlike the old Golden Visa, this route requires a detailed business plan approved by ENISA (Empresa Nacional de Innovación S.A.).

## The Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) for Passive Investors

The NLV is the standard alternative for those who do not wish to work. While it does not allow employment, it is the simplest transition for those with existing wealth. In 2026, the income requirement is based on the IPREM (Indicador Público de Renta de Efectos Múltiples).

The main applicant must show 400% of the IPREM. For 2026, we recommend showing at least €30,000 in a liquid bank account to ensure a smooth approval process. This permit is valid for one year, followed by two renewals of two years each.

## Transitioning to Permanent Residency

Regardless of the path chosen, all these alternatives lead to permanent residency after five years of legal stay. To maintain your status, you must spend at least 183 days per year in Spain. This is a significant change from the old Golden Visa, which only required one visit per year. If you intend to spend less time in Spain, you may need to consult with us regarding specific tax residency implications.

### Can I still apply for the Golden Visa if I bought property before the law changed?
If you completed your property purchase and submitted your initial application before the 2025 cutoff, your rights are generally protected. However, renewals now face stricter scrutiny regarding the continued maintenance of the investment.

### How long does it take to process an Entrepreneur Visa?
The UGE (Unidad de Grandes Empresas) typically resolves these applications within 20 to 30 working days. The bottleneck is often the preliminary ENISA business plan approval, which can take up to three months.

### Do I need a Spanish bank account for these alternatives?
Yes. For both the NLV and the Entrepreneur Visa, showing funds in a Spanish bank account significantly increases the success rate of the application during the consulate review phase.
