Becoming a tax resident in Spain (spending 183+ days here) means you are liable for taxes on your **worldwide income**. However, thanks to Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs), you should rarely pay tax twice on the same Euro—if you file correctly.

## What is tax residency?

You are a tax resident if:
1.  You spend **183+ days** in Spain in a calendar year.
2.  Your "center of vital interests" (spouse, children, main business) is in Spain.

*Note: The "7-year rule" myths are false. Tax residency resets annually.*

## Spain-UK Double Tax Treaty

Post-Brexit, the 1976 treaty (updated 2014) remains in force.
* **Private Pensions:** Taxed ONLY in Spain (the country of residence).
* **Government Pensions (Civil Service):** Taxed ONLY in the UK. You must declare them in Spain as "exempt income" (they push you into a higher bracket for other income).
* **Rental Income:** Taxed in the UK first. Spain gives you a credit for tax paid to HMRC.

## Spain-US Double Tax Treaty

The US is unique because of "Citizenship-Based Taxation."
* **The Saving Clause:** The US reserves the right to tax citizens everywhere. You must file IRS Form 1040 *and* Spanish Modelo 100.
* **Tax Credits:** You generally use the **Foreign Tax Credit (FTC)** on your US return to offset Spanish taxes paid.
* **Social Security:** Under the Totalization Agreement, US Social Security benefits are taxable in Spain, but often at favorable rates if managed correctly.

## Government Pensions vs Private Pensions

This is the most common error point:
* **Public (Gov) Pensions:** Usually taxed at *source* (Country of origin).
* **Private (401k/SIPP):** Usually taxed at *residency* (Spain).
* **Lump Sums:** Be careful—Spain does not recognize the "25% tax-free lump sum" (UK) or Roth IRA tax-free withdrawals (US) in the same way. These are often fully taxable.

## How to claim relief (Form 210 vs 100)

* **Modelo 100:** Your annual resident tax return (June). You declare foreign income here and deduct tax already paid abroad.
* **Certificate of Tax Residency:** You may need to send this Spanish certificate to the UK (HMRC) or US financial institutions to stop them strictly withholding tax at source.

## FAQs

**Do I pay tax on my UK ISA or US Roth IRA?**
Yes. Spain does not recognize the tax-free status of ISAs or Roth IRAs. Gains/dividends inside these wrappers are taxable in Spain.

**What is the 'Exit Tax'?**
If you have substantial assets (shares >€4M) and leave Spain, you may be taxed on unrealized gains.
