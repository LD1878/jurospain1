  - question: "Is the €80 'Tarifa Plana' still available for new autónomos?"
    answer: "Yes, the flat rate (Tarifa Plana) remains at €80 per month for the first 12 months. In 2026, you can extend this for a second year if your net annual income remains below the Spanish Minimum Wage (SMI)."

## The 2026 Autónomo Landscape: Income-Based and Digital-First

Registering as an *autónomo* (self-employed worker) in Spain has undergone a massive digital transformation in 2026. Beyond the traditional tax registration, you are now entering a real-time reporting environment governed by the **VeriFactu** system. Whether you are a digital nomad, a consultant, or a local business owner, compliance in 2026 requires certified software and a precise understanding of your "Rendimientos Netos" (Net Income).

## 2026 Social Security Quotas (RETA)

Spain continues to use the "Real Income" system introduced in 2023. You must estimate your annual net profit and select a corresponding contribution band. In late December 2025, the government announced a freeze on quota increases for 2026, keeping rates stable to assist with economic recovery.

| Monthly Net Income Band | 2026 Monthly Quota (Estimated) | MEI Contribution (0.9%) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below €670** | €230 | Included |
| **€1,300 to €1,500** | €294 | Included |
| **€2,330 to €2,760** | €350 | Included |
| **Over €6,000** | €530+ | Included |

**Important Note on MEI:** The Intergenerational Equity Mechanism (MEI) has increased to 0.9% for 2026. This is automatically factored into your monthly quota by the Social Security office, but it represents a slight rise in the "invisible" cost of your contributions.

## The July 2026 VeriFactu Mandate: No More Excel Invoices

The biggest operational shift for 2026 is the mandatory implementation of **VeriFactu**. As of July 1, 2026, the Spanish Tax Agency (AEAT) no longer accepts invoices generated via Word, Excel, or uncertified PDF templates.

1.  **Certified Software:** You must use an AEAT-certified billing system that ensures "immutability." Once an invoice is issued, it cannot be deleted or altered.
2.  **QR Codes and Fingerprints:** Every invoice must now feature a QR code. This allows the recipient (and the tax office) to instantly verify the authenticity of the document.
3.  **Real-Time Reporting:** While you can choose to store records locally, the "VeriFactu Mode" allows for automatic, real-time transmission of every invoice to Hacienda, which significantly reduces your audit risk profile.

## The €80 Flat Rate (Tarifa Plana) and Regional Bonuses

For those registering for the first time in 2026, the **Tarifa Plana** remains the most significant incentive. You pay just €80 per month for the first year. 

* **The Year 2 Extension:** In 2026, you must manually request the extension for months 13 to 24 via the *Import@ss* portal. This is only granted if your income stays below the SMI.
* **The "Zero Quota" Regions:** If you register in Andalusia, Madrid, or Murcia, these regional governments may reimburse 100% of your first year's quotas. In our 15 years of handling visa audits, we have found that timing your registration with these regional grants can save you over €960 in your first year.

## Quarterly Taxes: IVA and IRPF in 2026

As an autónomo, you act as a tax collector for the Spanish state. You must manage two primary taxes every quarter:

* **IVA (VAT):** Usually 21%. You collect this from clients and pay it to Hacienda via **Modelo 303**. In 2026, the threshold for "reverse charge" for EU B2B services remains strict; ensure you have a valid VIES/ROI number before invoicing European clients.
* **IRPF (Income Tax):** Most professionals pay a 20% "on account" payment of their profits via **Modelo 130**. If you are a new autónomo, you can often apply a reduced 7% retention on your invoices for the first three years to help with cash flow.

## The "Crea y Crece" Law: B2B E-Invoicing

While VeriFactu handles the *security* of your invoices, the **Ley Crea y Crece** (Create and Grow Law) governs the *format*. By late 2026, all B2B (Business to Business) transactions in Spain must be done using "structured" electronic invoices (FacturaE or XML). A simple PDF will no longer be legally sufficient for transactions between two Spanish companies.

### Can I be an autónomo if I have a full-time job (Pluriactividad)?
Yes. If you are already employed and paying into the General Social Security regime, you are eligible for a 50% reduction in your autónomo quotas for the first 18 months, followed by a 25% reduction for the next 18 months.

### What are 'Gastos de Difícil Justificación'?
In 2026, the "Hard to Justify Expenses" deduction remains at 7% of your net profit, capped at €2,000 per year. This is an automatic deduction that does not require specific receipts, designed to cover minor business costs.

### Can I deduct my home office expenses in 2026?
Yes, if you have registered your home address as your place of business with Hacienda (Modelo 036). You can typically deduct 30% of the proportional cost of utilities (water, gas, electricity, internet) based on the square footage of your office space.
