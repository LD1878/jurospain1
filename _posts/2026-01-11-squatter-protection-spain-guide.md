  - question: "What is the 2026 'Express Eviction' law in Spain?"
    answer: "The 2025 Anti-Squat Law (Organic Law 1/2025) allows for evictions within 48 hours of a flagrant entry. If the occupation is detected later, the new fast-track judicial process aims for a court-ordered removal within 15 days, significantly reducing the years-long delays seen in the past."
  - question: "Does a connected alarm system help with evictions?"
    answer: "Yes. An alarm connected to a central station is the most effective legal tool. It provides immediate proof of a break-in (flagrante delicto), allowing police to intervene and evict squatters instantly without a court order, provided they act within the first 48 hours."
  - question: "Can I cut off utilities if my Spanish home is occupied?"
    answer: "No. Even under the 2026 regulations, cutting off water, electricity, or gas is considered 'coercion' and is a criminal offense. You must follow the legal eviction path to avoid being charged yourself, though the new laws have made this path much faster."

## Squatting in Spain: The 2026 Legal Landscape for Owners

Illegal occupation, locally known as the "Okupa" phenomenon, remains a top concern for international property owners. However, 2026 marks a significant shift in favor of homeowners due to the **2025 Anti-Squat Reform (Organic Law 1/2025)**. This law closed many of the loopholes previously used by professional squatters and "mafias" to delay evictions for years. 

To protect your investment, you must understand the critical legal distinction between **Home Invasion** (*Allanamiento*) and **Usurpation** (*Usurpación*).

## Allanamiento vs. Usurpación: Why the Distinction Matters

For an expat owner, how the police classify the entry determines whether the squatters are out in hours or weeks.

| Concept | Home Invasion (Allanamiento) | Usurpation (Usurpación) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Property Type** | Main home or second/holiday home | Abandoned or long-term vacant buildings |
| **Legal Status** | A crime against the person (Privacy) | A crime against property (Wealth) |
| **Police Action** | Immediate eviction (Flagrant Crime) | Requires a fast-track court order |
| **2026 Resolution** | Hours or 48-hour window | 15-day fast-track trial |

In our 15 years of handling visa audits and property management, we have found that keeping a home "furnished and ready for use" is your best defense. If a property looks like a home, it is treated as an *Allanamiento*, triggering the fastest possible police response.

## Key Changes Under the 2025 Anti-Squat Law

The 2025 reform (fully operational in 2026) introduced several "pro-owner" measures:

* **Elimination of the 'Vulnerability' Loophole:** Previously, squatters could delay evictions by claiming social or economic vulnerability. In 2026, these assessments no longer block the eviction of private homes.
* **15-Day Fast-Track Trials:** If police cannot evict within the initial 48-hour window, the case moves to a summary judicial procedure where a judge must issue a ruling within 15 days.
* **Harsher Penalties for Mafias:** Organized groups that "rent out" occupied properties now face up to 4 years in prison under the updated Penal Code.

## Essential Preventive Measures for 2026

Preventing an entry is always more efficient than a legal battle. We recommend this 2026 security protocol:

1.  **Monitored Alarm Systems:** Use a service (like Securitas or Prosegur) connected to a central station. Their notification to the police counts as official evidence of a crime in progress.
2.  **Smart Home Simulation:** In 2026, use AI-driven smart plugs to simulate presence by cycling lights and shutters. This deters "scouts" who look for vacant holiday homes.
3.  **Security Doors (Grade 4+):** Reinforced doors with anti-bumping locks significantly increase the time required for a break-in, often discouraging squatters who seek "low-resistance" targets.
4.  **Local "Padrón" Registration:** Even for a second home, being registered at the town hall (*empadronamiento*) provides extra proof that the property is your personal "dwelling" and not an abandoned asset.

## What to Do if Your Property is Occupied

If you discover an intrusion, your reaction time is the most important factor:

* **Call 112 Immediately:** Do not attempt to enter the property or confront the occupants. Inform the police that a break-in has just occurred at your "dwelling" (*morada*).
* **Provide Deeds & ID:** Have digital copies of your *Escritura* (Property Deed) and your NIE/Passport ready. The police need to verify ownership on the spot to act under the 48-hour flagrancy rule.
* **Contact a Specialist Lawyer:** If the 48-hour window has passed, you will need to file a criminal complaint (*denuncia*) to trigger the 15-day fast-track eviction process.

### Can I hire a private 'desokupa' company?
While mediation companies exist, you must ensure they operate within the 2026 legal framework. Any use of force or intimidation can lead to criminal charges against you as the owner. We recommend sticking to legal and police-led channels, which are now significantly faster.

### Is my holiday home protected as a 'dwelling'?
Yes. Under Spanish Supreme Court rulings confirmed in the 2025 law, a second home or holiday home is considered a *morada* (dwelling) because you intend to return to it. This grants it the same "Home Invasion" protections as your primary residence.

### Should I keep my utilities in my name?
Absolutely. Active utility bills (water/electricity) are the strongest proof that a property is not abandoned. They also provide the necessary documentation for the police to prove that you are the active "dweller" of the property.
