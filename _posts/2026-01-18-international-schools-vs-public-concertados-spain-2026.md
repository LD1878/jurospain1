faqs:
  - question: "What is a 'Colegio Concertado'?"
    answer: "A Concertado is a 'semi-private' school. It is privately run (often by Catholic orders, though secular options exist) but funded by the government. Fees are low (typically €150-€300/month for 'voluntary' contributions) compared to private schools, but they follow the Spanish curriculum."
  - question: "Can I enroll my child in a Spanish public school in September?"
    answer: "Technically, yes, but it is risky. The official enrollment window ('Matriculación') opens in March/April for the following school year. If you arrive in September, you are subject to 'Out of Period' enrollment, meaning you only get spots in schools that are not full—usually the least desirable ones."
  - question: "Do International Schools in Spain require the TIE card for enrollment?"
    answer: "No. Private and International schools are businesses; they will accept your money and enroll your child with just a passport. This makes them the only viable option for families arriving mid-year without finalized residency."
  - question: "Is the Spanish public system good for non-Spanish speakers?"
    answer: "It depends on the age. For children under 7, it is excellent for total immersion. For teenagers (12+), throwing them into a rigid Spanish-only system without support can be disastrous. We almost always recommend International or Bilingual schools for older children."

If you are moving to Spain with children, you are likely losing sleep over one specific decision: **School.**

On one hand, you have the **International Schools**. They look like the schools back home. They speak English. They offer the IB Diploma. But they cost **€10,000 to €20,000 per year, per child.**

On the other hand, you have the **Spanish Public System**. It is free. It forces integration. But you worry: *"Will my child be the outcast who doesn't speak the language?"*

In 2026, the debate has changed. It is no longer just about "Curriculum" or "Cost."

It is about **Timing.**

## The "March Deadline" Nobody Tells You About

Here is the hard truth that relocation agents often skip: **The Spanish Public and Concertado systems run on a strict bureaucratic calendar.**

The enrollment window (*Periodo de Admisión*) typically opens in **March** and closes in **April** for the school year starting in September.

During this window, parents list their top choices, and spots are assigned based on a "Points System" (proximity to home, siblings in school, family income).

**The Trap:** Most Digital Nomads plan their move for the summer, arriving in June, July, or August.

By then, the system is closed.
If you arrive in August hoping to put your child in the "great public school down the street," you will likely be denied. You will be placed in the *Comisión de Escolarización* (Schooling Commission), which will assign your child to **any school that has empty desks.**

In major cities like Madrid or Barcelona, the "leftover" spots are rarely in the schools you want.

## The Three Tiers of Spanish Education

To make the right choice, you need to understand the "Middle Option."

### 1. Public Schools (*Colegios Públicos*)
* **Cost:** €0 (Books/Materials ~€300/yr).
* **Language:** 100% Spanish (or Catalan/Valencian/Basque depending on region).
* **The Verdict:** Fantastic for children under 8. They will be fluent in 6 months. For teenagers, it is sink or swim.
* **Barrier:** Strict zoning. You must be registered (*empadronado*) in the neighborhood to apply.

### 2. The "Concertados" (Semi-Private)
* **Cost:** €150 - €400 per month (officially "voluntary" donations, but effectively mandatory).
* **Language:** Spanish curriculum, often with better English support than public schools.
* **The Verdict:** This is the "Goldilocks" zone for many long-term expat families. Better facilities than public, stricter discipline, and a uniform.
* **Barrier:** Extremely high demand. The best Concertados fill up in March.

### 3. International Schools (*Privados*)
* **Cost:** €800 - €2,000 per month.
* **Language:** English / American / French / German.
* **The Verdict:** You are paying for **flexibility**. They have rolling admissions. They don't care about your *Padrón*. They understand expat anxiety.
* **Barrier:** The price tag. Also, the "Expat Bubble"—your kids might live in Spain for 5 years and never learn Spanish.

## The JuroSpain Strategy

We see too many families panic in September. Here is the playbook for 2026:

**Scenario A: You are moving in Summer (June-August)**
* **Do not gamble on public schools.** You will likely not get a spot in a good school.
* **Strategy:** Bite the bullet and pay for an **International School** for Year 1. This guarantees your child a spot, a soft landing, and friends who speak English.
* **The Pivot:** Once you are settled and have your *Padrón*, apply for a Public/Concertado school the *following* March for Year 2.

**Scenario B: You are moving in Spring (Feb-March)**
* **Rush your Padrón.** You cannot apply for a public school without an address.
* **Strategy:** Rent an apartment immediately. Even a temporary one (if the landlord allows registration). Use that address to apply during the official March window.

## The "Age" Factor

* **Ages 0-6:** Go Public/Concertado. Save the money. The brain is plastic; they will adapt instantly.
* **Ages 7-11:** Concertado is ideal. A mix of structure and support.
* **Ages 12+:** Go International. Throwing a 14-year-old into a Biology class taught in Spanish (or Catalan) is often too traumatic and can set their grades back years.

Don't let the "Free" price tag blind you to the logistics. In Spain, you either pay with **money** (International School) or you pay with **planning** (Public School).
