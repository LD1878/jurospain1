faqs:
  - question: "Can I work remotely on a Non-Lucrative Visa in 2026?"
    answer: "No. The Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) is strictly for those who do not intend to work. While some consulates were flexible in the past, the 2026 standard is clear: if you plan to perform any remote work, you must apply for the Digital Nomad Visa instead."
  - question: "Which visa is better for retirees in Spain?"
    answer: "The Non-Lucrative Visa is generally better for retirees. It is designed for those living on passive income like pensions or dividends. It does not require the complex business documentation or Social Security registration associated with the Digital Nomad Visa."
  - question: "Can I switch from a Non-Lucrative Visa to a Digital Nomad Visa?"
    answer: "Yes. If your situation changes and you wish to start working remotely, you can apply for a modification of your residency status from within Spain, provided you meet the professional and income requirements of the nomad route."

## NLV or Digital Nomad Visa: Which is right for you in 2026?

Choosing between the Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) and the Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) depends entirely on whether you intend to work. The NLV is for passive residents like retirees or those on a sabbatical. The DNV is for active remote workers. Both paths lead to permanent residency after five years, but they have very different tax and income hurdles.

## 2026 Requirements Comparison Table

| Feature | Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) | Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Retirement or passive living | Remote employment or freelancing |
| **Work Allowed** | No (strictly prohibited) | Yes (remote only) |
| **Min. Income (Individual)** | €28,800 per year | ~€33,150+ per year (200% SMI) |
| **Income Source** | Savings, pensions, dividends | Salary or freelance contracts |
| **Tax Regime** | Standard progressive rates | Optional Beckham Law (24% flat) |
| **Apply from Spain?** | No (must apply in home country) | Yes (3-year permit available) |

## The Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV): The Passive Path

The NLV remains the most popular choice for retirees and individuals with significant savings. In 2026, the financial requirement is tied to the IPREM (Public Income Indicator). The main applicant must demonstrate 400% of this indicator.

For 2026, this translates to €2,400 per month or €28,800 per year. For every family member you bring, you must show an additional €7,200 annually. In our 15 years of handling visa audits, we recommend showing slightly more than the minimum to avoid denials based on currency fluctuations. The funds must be "liquid," meaning they are immediately accessible in a bank account.

## The Digital Nomad Visa (DNV): The Remote Work Path

If you earn a salary from a company outside of Spain, the DNV is your primary option. This visa was updated in late 2025 to reflect the rising cost of living and the new Spanish Minimum Wage (SMI).

To qualify in 2026, you must earn at least 200% of the SMI. This currently sits at approximately €2,763 per month. Unlike the NLV, the DNV allows you to apply for the Beckham Law tax regime. This can significantly reduce your tax burden if you earn a high salary, as it caps your tax rate at 24% for your first six years in the country.

## Key 2026 Logistical Differences

A major advantage of the Digital Nomad Visa is that you can apply for it while in Spain on a tourist stay. This results in a three-year residence permit. The NLV, however, must be initiated at the Spanish consulate in your country of residence. This often involves a longer wait time and the submission of physical documents before you can move.

Health insurance requirements are similar for both. You must have a private policy with a Spanish provider that offers full coverage with no co-payments. Travel insurance or international policies with "reimbursement" clauses are generally rejected by Spanish immigration authorities in 2026.

## Choosing Based on Your Long-Term Goals

If your goal is to eventually work for a Spanish company or start a local business, the DNV offers a more flexible bridge. If you are moving to Spain to enjoy a quiet life without professional obligations, the NLV is a simpler, less bureaucratic process. 

Both visas require you to spend more than 183 days per year in Spain to renew your status. If you plan to travel extensively outside of Spain, you must carefully track your days to ensure you remain eligible for permanent residency at the five-year mark.

### Can I include my parents on these visas?
Yes, both visas allow for the inclusion of dependent parents. However, you must prove that they are financially dependent on you and that there is a legitimate reason why they cannot live alone in their home country.

### Does the Digital Nomad Visa require Social Security payments?
Yes. If you are a freelancer (autónomo), you must register with the Spanish Social Security system and pay monthly contributions. If you are an employee, your company may need to prove they are paying equivalent social taxes in a country with a bilateral agreement with Spain.

### What happens if the IPREM or SMI increases mid-year?
Applications are generally assessed based on the rates in effect on the day you submit your file. If the government announces an increase for 2027, it will not affect your 2026 submission, but it will impact your renewal requirements in the future.
