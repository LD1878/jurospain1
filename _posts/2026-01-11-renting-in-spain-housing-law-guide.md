faqs:
  - question: "Who pays the agency fee for rentals in Spain in 2026?"
    answer: "Under the 2026 application of the Housing Law, the landlord (owner) is legally required to pay the real estate agency fees for long-term residential leases. Tenants should never be charged for 'management' or 'agency' fees on long-term contracts."
  - question: "What is a 'Stressed Market' (Zona Tensionada)?"
    answer: "In 2026, many cities like Barcelona, Madrid, and Málaga are declared 'Stressed Markets.' In these zones, rental price increases are capped by the government, and owners cannot exceed the price index established for the area."
  - question: "Can a landlord force a 11-month 'seasonal' contract?"
    answer: "Landlords often use 11-month contracts to bypass tenant protections. However, in 2026, if the property is your primary residence, the contract is legally treated as long-term (5-7 years) regardless of the written duration."

## Navigating the 2026 Spanish Rental Market

Renting in Spain has become a legal minefield due to the full implementation of the **2023-2025 Housing Law (Ley de Vivienda)**. For expats, the market in 2026 is defined by a lack of inventory and a rise in "Alternative Contracts." To secure a home without being exploited, you must understand your rights regarding fees, deposits, and contract duration.

## The Agency Fee Ban: A 2026 Reality

The most significant win for tenants in 2026 is the ban on agency fees. Historically, expats were charged one month's rent as a "finder's fee." **This is now illegal for long-term residential leases (Vivienda Habitual).**

If an agency asks you to pay for "contract drafting" or "administration," they are likely violating the law. In our 15 years of handling visa audits and relocation, we have seen that agencies often target foreigners who are unaware of this shift. Only "Temporary" or "Seasonal" rentals for non-residential purposes are exempt from this rule.

## 2026 Rental Caps and the "Zona Tensionada"

If you are moving to a major city, your rent increase is likely capped. In 2026, the government uses a specific **Rental Reference Index** to prevent price gouging in high-demand areas.

* **Annual Increases:** For existing contracts, the rent increase is capped (typically at 3% or linked to a new index, not CPI).
* **Price Caps:** For new contracts in stressed zones, the price cannot exceed the previous contract's rent plus a small allowed adjustment.

## The "11-Month Contract" Trap

A common 2026 tactic used by landlords is the 11-month "Seasonal" contract (*Contrato de Temporada*). They do this to avoid the 5-year mandatory renewal rule. 

**The Legal Truth:** If you are moving to Spain to live, work, and you have a residency permit, the law views the property as your "Permanent Home." In 2026, Spanish courts are increasingly "converting" these 11-month contracts into 5-year contracts (7 years for corporate owners) upon the tenant's request. Do not let the "11-month" label deter you from your rights as a resident.

## Deposits and Guarantees: The "Fianza" Rules

In 2026, the law limits the amount of "extra" security a landlord can ask for:

1.  **Mandatory Fianza:** One month’s rent (which must be deposited by the landlord in a regional government account).
2.  **Additional Guarantee:** A maximum of two additional months' rent.
3.  **Total Maximum:** You should never be required to pay more than three months of rent upfront as a security deposit for a residential lease.

## The "Aval Bancario" (Bank Guarantee)

For expats without a Spanish work history, landlords often request an *Aval Bancario*. This is a bank guarantee where a Spanish bank "freezes" 6 to 12 months of rent in your account to guarantee payment. While common, it is a significant cash-flow hurdle. In 2026, many savvy expats are using **Rental Insurance (Seguro de Impago)** as an alternative, which is often cheaper and more flexible.

### Can a landlord refuse to rent to me because I am a foreigner?
Direct discrimination is illegal, but landlords often ask for "financial stability" (Spanish payslips). If you are on a Digital Nomad Visa, providing your apostilled foreign contract and a few months of bank statements is usually sufficient to prove solvency in 2026.

### What is the 'Padrón' and why is it linked to my lease?
Your lease agreement gives you the right to register at the Town Hall (*empadronamiento*). This is the most important document for healthcare, schooling, and residency renewals. Ensure your contract specifically allows you to use the address for the *Padrón*.
