One of the most common questions we get at JURO Spain is:
*"I got the Digital Nomad Visa, but can my boyfriend/girlfriend come with me?"*

The answer is **Yes**, but "Love" is not a legal document in Spain.

If you are not married, you cannot simply list them as a "spouse." Instead, you must prove you are a **Stable Couple (*Pareja de Hecho*)**.

In 2026, the rules for proving this are strict. This guide explains how to bring your unmarried partner to Spain without getting rejected.

## What is "Pareja de Hecho"?

*Pareja de Hecho* (Civil Partnership) is a legal status in Spain that grants unmarried couples almost the same residency rights as married couples.

Once registered, your partner becomes eligible to apply for their residency as a **Dependent** on your Digital Nomad Visa or Non-Lucrative Visa.

## Route 1: Proving it from Home (The Hard Way)

If you want to apply for the visa *together* from your home country (e.g., at the Spanish Consulate in London or NYC), you must prove your relationship is "comparable to marriage."

**This is difficult.** Consulates typically require:
1.  **Proof of Cohabitation:** 12+ months of joint rental contracts or bank accounts.
2.  **Certificate of Civil Status:** Proving you are both single.
3.  **Registration:** A certificate showing you are registered as a partnership in your home country/state.

*> **The Risk:** If the consulate officer feels your proof isn't strong enough, they will approve YOU and deny YOUR PARTNER.*

## Route 2: The "Tourist Switch" Strategy (The Easy Way)

This is the strategy used by 90% of our clients.

1.  **Enter Spain:** The main applicant enters on their visa. The partner enters as a **Tourist** (90 days).
2.  **The Notary:** We book an appointment with a Spanish Notary. You both attend and sign a **"Manifestation of Stable Couple"** deed.
3.  **The Registration:** We register this deed with the Andalusian (or relevant region) Registry of Couples.
4.  **The Application:** Once registered (takes 2-4 weeks), we submit your partner's residency application from *inside* Spain.

*> **Why this works:** The Spanish Notary deed is legally binding. Immigration cannot argue with it.*

## The "Public Deed" Requirement

You cannot just write a letter saying "we are together." It must be a **Public Deed (*Escritura Pública*)**.

To sign this, you need:
* Two Passports.
* **Certificates of Marital Status:** Issued by your home country (sworn translated into Spanish) stating you are currently SINGLE. This proves you aren't secretly married to someone else!
* **Empadronamiento:** Proof you are living together at the same address in Spain.

## Documents You Need

Start gathering these **before** you fly:

1.  **Birth Certificates:** (Apostilled & Translated).
2.  **Certificate of No Marriage / Single Status:** (Apostilled & Translated).
3.  **Joint Bank Statements:** Previous 6-12 months (shows financial unity).
4.  **Photos/History:** Sometimes helpful, but legal docs matter more.

## FAQs

**Does my partner get permission to work?**
Yes. As a dependent on a Digital Nomad Visa, once their residency is approved, they have **full work rights** in Spain (either for a company or as a freelancer).

**How long does the registration take?**
It varies by region.
* **Madrid:** Fast (but strict).
* **Andalusia (Malaga):** Can take 1-3 months. We often recommend the Notary route as it is instant for the "Deed," even if the "Registration" takes longer.

**Can we do this on a Tourist Visa?**
Yes, but you are racing the 90-day clock. You must enter, find an apartment, get the *Empadronamiento*, sign the Notary deed, and submit the application before your 90 days are up.
