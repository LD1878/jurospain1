The era of buying Spanish residency for €500,000 officially ended in April 2025. With the termination of the real estate Golden Visa route, many investors are asking: **Can I still get residency if I buy a home in Spain?**

The short answer is yes—but the pathway has changed. You can no longer get a visa *automatically* by purchasing property, but owning a home significantly strengthens applications for other visas. This guide outlines the top alternatives for 2025.

## Why the Golden Visa ended

The Spanish government phased out the real estate investment route to combat housing speculation in major cities like Madrid and Barcelona.
* **Status:** The law passed in early 2025 abolished the €500k property route.
* **Existing holders:** Renewals for visas granted *before* the cutoff date are still honored.
* **New applicants:** Must use the routes below.

## Alternative 1: The Digital Nomad Visa (DNV)

For property buyers who are still working, this is the superior alternative (and tax-efficient).
* **Eligibility:** Remote workers with income outside Spain (€2,600+/month approx).
* **Property Link:** You can buy a home immediately without affecting your visa status.
* **Tax Benefit:** Access to the "Beckham Law" (flat 24% tax) which the Golden Visa did not offer.

## Alternative 2: The Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV)

The classic route for retirees or those with passive income.
* **Requirement:** Show ~€28,800 in savings/passive income (IPREM rates 2025).
* **Restriction:** You cannot work for a Spanish company.
* **Property Link:** Buying a home removes the need to show a rental contract, a major hurdle for NLV applicants.

## Does buying property still help?

Yes. While it doesn't *grant* the visa, owning a property:
* **Proves "Accommodation":** A mandatory requirement for DNV and NLV applications.
* **Reduces liquidity needs:** You don't need to show funds for rent if you own your home.
* **Long-term stability:** Helps with permanent residency applications after 5 years.

## The "Golden Visa" for investors (non-real estate)

The Golden Visa Law still exists for other investment types, though less common:
* **€1 Million** in Spanish company shares.
* **€1 Million** in Spanish bank deposits.
* **€2 Million** in Spanish government bonds.

## FAQs

**I applied before April 2025, is my Golden Visa safe?**
Yes. The law is not retroactive. You can renew as long as you keep the investment.

**Can I switch from a Tourist Visa to a Nomad Visa if I buy a house?**
Yes, you can apply for the DNV directly from Spain within your 90-day tourist stay.
