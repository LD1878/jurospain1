faqs:
  - question: "Is the Beckham Law better than Portugal’s NHR 2.0?"
    answer: "For high earners, the Beckham Law is often superior in 2026. It offers a flat 24% tax rate for six years on Spanish income. Portugal’s NHR 2.0 has become more restrictive, focusing on specific high-value professional categories rather than general remote work."
  - question: "Which country has a faster residency process in 2026?"
    answer: "Spain is currently faster for remote workers. The Spanish Digital Nomad Visa features a 20-day 'Positive Administrative Silence' rule, whereas Portuguese AIMA (formerly SEF) appointments can still take several months to secure."
  - question: "Is the cost of living higher in Spain or Portugal in 2026?"
    answer: "The cost of living is comparable, but real estate in major Portuguese hubs like Lisbon and Porto has risen sharply. Mid-size Spanish cities like Valencia and Málaga currently offer a better 'Lifestyle ROI' in terms of infrastructure versus housing costs."

## Spain vs. Portugal: The 2026 Expat Landscape

In 2026, the choice between Spain and Portugal is no longer about the weather. It is about **administrative efficiency** and **tax optimization**. While Portugal was the early favorite for expats, Spain’s 2025-2026 digital reforms and the 20-day approval guarantee for Digital Nomad Visas have shifted the momentum back to the Mediterranean.

## 2026 Financial and Visa Comparison

| Feature | Spain (2026) | Portugal (2026) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nomad Visa Speed** | 20 Working Days (Guaranteed) | 3 to 8 Months (Variable) |
| **Tax Incentive** | Beckham Law (24% Flat Rate) | NHR 2.0 (Category Restricted) |
| **Path to Citizenship** | 10 Years (2 for LatAm) | 5 Years |
| **Digital Infrastructure** | High (Fiber/5G Everywhere) | High in Hubs / Variable in Rural |
| **Administrative System** | Centralized Digital Portal | In-Person AIMA Appointments |

## Why Spain is Winning the "Admin Race" in 2026

The primary complaint among expats in Portugal in 2026 remains the backlog at AIMA (the agency replacing SEF). In contrast, the Spanish **UGE-CE** (Unidad de Grandes Empresas) has successfully moved to a centralized digital submission model. 

For a JuroSpain client, this means we can submit a Digital Nomad Visa on a Monday and have a legal resolution by the end of the month. This level of predictability is vital for families who need to book international movers and enroll children in schools.

## Tax Optimization: Beckham Law vs. NHR 2.0

The "Golden Age" of Portugal’s NHR (Non-Habitual Resident) tax regime ended in 2024. Its successor, NHR 2.0, is targeted specifically at researchers, tech innovators, and specialized industries. 

Spain’s **Beckham Law** remains more accessible for the average remote professional or corporate executive. If you earn over €55,000, the 24% flat tax rate in Spain almost always results in a lower tax bill than the progressive rates in Portugal. Furthermore, Spain’s recent 100% Wealth Tax bonuses in regions like Andalusia and Madrid have removed one of the major "deal-breakers" for high-net-worth individuals.

## Connectivity and the "Second City" Trend

In 2026, the cost of living in Lisbon has surpassed that of Madrid and Barcelona in several key metrics. This has led to the rise of Spanish "Value Cities."

* **Málaga:** Now considered the tech capital of Southern Europe, offering better connectivity than the Algarve.
* **Valencia:** Consistently voted the #1 city for expats due to its balance of green space and beach access.
* **Alicante:** The preferred choice for those seeking a large English-speaking community and an affordable Mediterranean lifestyle.

### Can I hold residency in both Spain and Portugal?
No. You can only be a tax resident in one EU country at a time. Spending more than 183 days in either country will trigger tax residency.

### Is the Spanish language easier for expats than Portuguese?
Many English speakers find Spanish phonetics more intuitive than European Portuguese. In 2026, the availability of high-quality, digital-first Spanish language schools is a major draw for the nomad community.
