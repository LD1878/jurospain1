faqs:
  - question: "Can I manage my own investments while on an NLV?"
    answer: "Yes. In 2026, Spanish immigration clarifies that managing your personal wealth, stock portfolio, or crypto assets is considered a 'passive' activity. It does not constitute 'working' in Spain, provided you are not managing third-party funds or trading as a professional business."
  - question: "How do I maintain my home bank accounts with a Spanish address?"
    answer: "Many expats use a 'Dual-SIM' strategy. Keep your original phone number on an eSIM for 2FA bank verification codes while using a Spanish physical SIM for local data. This prevents banks from freezing accounts due to an unrecognized foreign login."
  - question: "What is the 'Shadow Period' for Spanish tax residency?"
    answer: "If you enter Spain on an NLV after July 2nd, you will spend fewer than 183 days in the country for that calendar year. This typically allows you to remain a non-tax resident until January 1st of the following year, protecting your global income from Spanish tax for those first six months."

## The Non-Lucrative Visa in 2026: High-Intent Strategy

The Spain Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) remains the gold standard for those with passive wealth, but the 2026 application landscape has become more technical. Success now requires more than just a bank statement. You must prove the **provenance of funds** and demonstrate that your life in Spain will not inadvertently trigger a "work" violation.

## Strategic Timing: The "183-Day" Entrance Plan

A common mistake is moving to Spain in the first quarter of the year. If you arrive in March, you will exceed the 183-day threshold for tax residency by September. In our 15 years of handling visa audits, we often advise clients to target a **late-year arrival**.

By entering Spain in August or September, you can spend your first several months setting up your home and lifestyle without becoming a Spanish tax resident for that year. This "Shadow Period" is vital for individuals selling assets or businesses in their home country, as it prevents the Spanish Tax Agency from claiming a percentage of those capital gains.

## Managing 2FA and Financial "Geo-Locking"

Modern residency involves a digital hurdle: maintaining your home-country financial infrastructure. Many US and UK banks will close accounts if they detect a permanent move to Spain.

1.  **The eSIM Solution:** Before leaving your home country, convert your primary mobile number to an eSIM. This allows you to receive the SMS verification codes required for 2026 banking apps.
2.  **The VoIP Fallback:** Services like Google Voice or Skype Numbers are often rejected by banks for "Short Code" SMS. A physical eSIM is the only reliable way to manage your passive income sources from abroad.
3.  **Address Updates:** Use a trusted relative's address or a "private mailbox" service in your home country to keep your accounts open for the duration of your first year.

## Proving Passive Income: Beyond the €28,800 Minimum

While the 2026 IPREM requires €28,800 for a single applicant, a "thin" file often leads to a request for more evidence. To ensure a first-time approval, your financial dossier should include:

* **Dividends and Interest:** Certificates from your brokerage showing a 12-month history of payouts.
* **Rental Income:** Notarized leases and the corresponding bank entries showing the rent arriving every month.
* **The "Professional Experience" Filter:** If you are of working age, you must prove you have "retired" from your previous role. A simple bank balance is often not enough. You need a termination of employment letter or a board resolution confirming you have stepped down from active management.

## Passive Business Ownership vs. Working

A major point of confusion in 2026 is the role of a business owner. You **can** own 100% of a foreign company while on a Non-Lucrative Visa. You **cannot** perform the daily operations of that company.

If you are a majority shareholder, you should provide an organizational chart showing that a Managing Director or CEO is running the business. This "Hands-Off" proof is the difference between an approval and a rejection based on the suspicion that you are actually a digital nomad trying to avoid Social Security payments.

## Navigating the 2026 Digital Residency Overhaul

Starting in 2026, Spain has centralized all residency renewals through a unified digital platform. For NLV holders, this means your **effective residency** is tracked more closely. The authorities now cross-reference your "Padrón" (town hall registration) with your actual presence in the country. If you plan to travel extensively outside of Spain, ensure you do not stay out for more than six months in any given year, or your renewal will be denied.

### Can I volunteer while on an NLV?
Yes. You can participate in unpaid volunteer work for registered non-profit organizations. This is a great way to integrate into the Spanish community without violating the "no work" clause of your visa.

### Does the NLV allow me to buy property?
Yes. There are no restrictions on buying real estate. In fact, owning your home in Spain is often viewed favorably during your first renewal, as it shows a clear intention to remain in the country.

### What happens if I inherit money while in Spain?
Inheritances are subject to regional Inheritance Tax in Spain. Even on an NLV, you must report this to the tax authorities. The rates vary significantly between regions like Valencia, Andalusia, and Madrid.
