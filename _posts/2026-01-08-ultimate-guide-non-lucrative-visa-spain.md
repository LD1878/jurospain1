  - question: "How long is the first Non-Lucrative Visa valid for?"
    answer: "The initial NLV residency permit is valid for one year. Upon renewal, you are granted a two-year extension, provided you still meet the financial and residency requirements, including the 183-day stay rule."

## What is the Spain Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV)?

The Spain Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) is a residence permit designed for non-EU citizens who wish to live in Spain without engaging in any labor or professional activity. Often called the "Spain Retirement Visa," it is the primary route for retirees, individuals with significant savings, and those living off passive income. It grants full residency rights and allows for visa-free travel throughout the Schengen Area.

## 2026 Financial Requirements: The IPREM Thresholds

In 2026, the financial viability of your application is determined by the **IPREM** (Indicador Público de Renta de Efectos Múltiples). To secure approval, you must prove you have 400% of the IPREM for the main applicant and 100% for each dependent.

| Applicant Category | Monthly Requirement (2026) | Annual Requirement (2026) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Applicant** | €2,400 | €28,800 |
| **Spouse / Partner** | +€600 | +€7,200 |
| **Each Child** | +€600 | +€7,200 |

In our 15 years of handling visa audits, we have observed that consulates prefer to see "liquid" funds. While property ownership in your home country shows stability, the Spanish authorities require proof that the cash is available in a bank account for your daily living expenses. We recommend maintaining a "buffer" of at least 10% above these minimums to account for currency fluctuations during the processing period.

## Acceptable Sources of Passive Income

To satisfy the 2026 requirements, your income must be recurring and independent of active work. Valid sources include:

* **State or Private Pensions:** Official letters detailing your monthly or annual payout.
* **Dividends and Investments:** Statements from brokerage accounts or certificates of deposit.
* **Rental Income:** Notarized rental contracts accompanied by bank statements showing the last six to twelve months of deposits.
* **Significant Savings:** A lump sum in a liquid account that covers the entire first year (minimum €28,800).

Note: If you are of working age, some consulates may request a "letter of resignation" or an affidavit stating that you will not work while residing in Spain to ensure the non-lucrative nature of your stay.

## Critical Documents Checklist for 2026

Preparing your dossier for the Spanish consulate requires precision. All foreign documents must be translated into Spanish by a sworn translator (traductor jurado) and legalized with the Apostille of the Hague.

1.  **National Visa Form (EX-01):** Completed and signed in duplicate.
2.  **Valid Passport:** Must have at least one year of validity remaining and two blank pages.
3.  **Criminal Record Check:** Issued within the last six months by the national authorities of the countries where you have lived for the past five years.
4.  **Health Insurance for Residency:** A policy with a Spanish-authorized provider offering full coverage, no co-payments, and no deductibles.
5.  **Medical Certificate:** A signed statement from a doctor confirming you do not have any diseases with serious public health repercussions.
6.  **Proof of Accommodation:** While not always mandatory at every consulate, showing a long-term lease or property deed (Escritura) significantly strengthens your application.

## The TIE Card and the 183-Day Rule

Once your visa is approved, you have 90 days to enter Spain. After arrival, you must apply for your **TIE card** (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero) at the local police station within your first 30 days. This involves a fingerprint appointment and providing your "Empadronamiento" (local town hall registration).

Crucially, the Non-Lucrative Visa requires you to be a physical resident. To renew your residency after the first year, you must prove you spent at least 183 days in Spain. This status also makes you a tax resident in the eyes of the Spanish Tax Agency, meaning you will be liable for tax on your worldwide income.

## Common Reasons for NLV Denial in 2026

* **Inadequate Passive Income Proof:** Relying on erratic freelance income or non-liquid assets.
* **Health Insurance Gaps:** Submitting policies with co-payments or those from non-Spanish providers.
* **Criminal Records:** Even minor offenses from years ago can trigger a rejection if not properly addressed.
* **Intent Doubts:** If the consulate suspects you plan to work remotely, they will direct you toward the Digital Nomad Visa instead.

No. While it is commonly used by retirees, people of all ages can apply as long as they meet the financial requirements and prove they do not need to work.

### Can I invest in Spanish businesses with this visa?
