faqs:
  - question: "Can I use a standard DBS check for the Spanish DNV?"
    answer: "No. Spanish immigration strictly requires the ACRO Police Certificate. A basic or enhanced DBS check will be rejected immediately, forcing you to restart the process and lose your application fee."
  - question: "Do I still need to pay UK National Insurance?"
    answer: "It depends. If you obtain the A1 Certificate from HMRC, you can remain in the UK system for up to 2 years. Without it, you must register as 'Autónomo' in Spain and pay Spanish Social Security (approx €300/month after the first year)."
  - question: "Is it faster to apply from London or within Spain?"
    answer: "Applying from within Spain (during your 90-day tourist stay) is significantly faster. The UGE-CE in Madrid typically resolves applications in 20 business days, whereas the Spanish Consulate in London is currently facing backlogs of 3-4 months."

## The "Invisible" Wall for British Applicants

Since Brexit, the romantic idea of "just moving to Spain" has been replaced by a rigid wall of paperwork. For British citizens in 2026, the Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) is the most viable path, but it is not a "rubber stamp" process.

The biggest shock for our UK clients isn't the income requirement (approx. £2,300/month)—it's the **provenance of paperwork**. Spanish authorities do not trust simple PDFs. Every document, from your marriage certificate to your ACRO background check, must be **Apostilled** by the FCDO and translated by a *Traductor Jurado* (Sworn Translator). Missing a single stamp can pause your application for weeks.

## The Reality of "Spanish Time": Speed vs. Strategy

How long does it take? That depends entirely on *where* you file.

* **The "Slow" Route (London Consulate):** If you apply from the UK, you are subject to the consulate's appointment availability. In 2026, we are seeing wait times of **3 to 4 months** just for a decision.
* **The "Fast" Route (In-Country Application):** This is the strategy we recommend for 90% of clients. You enter Spain as a tourist and file digitally through the UGE-CE (Unit for Large Companies). By law, they must respond within **20 business days**.

**Warning:** This speed comes with risk. If you are rejected while in Spain and your 90-day tourist allowance runs out, you may be required to leave the Schengen zone immediately. This is why "DIY" applications from within Spain are dangerous.

## The Cost of Professional Help: Why Fees Vary

You will see online services offering visa processing for €500 and law firms charging €2,500+. Why the gap?

The difference lies in the **audit of your employment status**. The #1 reason for rejection in 2026 is "Simulation of Employment"—when the Spanish government believes you are a contractor disguised as an employee to avoid taxes.

* **Cheap Services:** They will upload whatever PDF you give them. If the examiner asks a complex tax question about your "Permanent Establishment" risk, they often cannot answer.
* **Legal Counsel:** We review your contract *before* submission. We draft the necessary "Certificate of Coverage" arguments to ensure you don't accidentally trigger a tax audit in the UK.

**The Price of Failure:**
Paying a lawyer seems expensive until you calculate the cost of a rejection:
* Lost non-refundable government fees (€100+ per person).
* Cost of new apostilles and translations (£200+).
* Flights back to the UK if your tourist visa expires.

Investing in a proper case review is not just a legal fee; it is an insurance policy against the bureaucracy.
