faqs:
  - question: "Why is the US Certificate of Coverage so hard to get for Digital Nomads?"
    answer: "The US-Spain Social Security Treaty was written in the 1980s for 'posted workers' (temporarily sent by a company). It was not written for voluntary remote workers. The SSA frequently rejects applications if they feel you are moving for personal reasons, not business necessity."
  - question: "If I become a contractor, do I pay double Social Security?"
    answer: "No. In fact, you might pay LESS. By paying into the Spanish system (RETA), the US-Spain Totalization Agreement exempts you from US Self-Employment Tax (15.3%). For high earners, the Spanish fee is often lower than the US tax."
  - question: "Can I still get the Beckham Law as a Freelancer/Contractor?"
    answer: "Yes. The 2023 Startup Law expanded the Beckham Law (Special Expats Regime) to include 'International Teleworkers' (Digital Nomad Visa holders), regardless of whether they are employees or freelancers."
  - question: "Will my US company get in trouble if I work from Spain?"
    answer: "If you remain a W-2 employee, yes—they technically risk creating a 'Permanent Establishment' in Spain. If you switch to a 1099 Contractor, you remove this risk entirely. You become a B2B service provider, protecting their liability."

If you are an American employed by a US company (W-2) applying for the Spanish Digital Nomad Visa, your HR department is likely nervous.

They are right to be.

The single biggest point of failure for US applicants in 2026 is not income, and it is not criminal records. It is **Social Security.**

Specifically, the infamous **Certificate of Coverage**.

Here is the reality: trying to force a W-2 employment relationship through the Spanish immigration system is like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. It is possible, but it is painful, slow, and prone to rejection.

The solution? **The "Contractor Flip."**

## The "Certificate of Coverage" Trap

To get the Digital Nomad Visa as an employee, Spain demands proof that your company is paying Social Security for you. Since they are a US company, they don't pay Spanish Social Security.

So, Spain asks for a **Certificate of Coverage** from the US Social Security Administration (SSA). This document says: *"This person is covered by the US, so Spain agrees not to charge them."*

**The Problem:** The SSA often refuses to issue this certificate for remote workers.

The US-Spain treaty is designed for "Posted Workers"—executives sent to Madrid for 2 years to open a branch. It is *not* designed for a software engineer who just wants to live in Valencia for the lifestyle.

If the SSA denies your certificate (which happens frequently), your visa application is dead on arrival.

## The Solution: Switch to 1099 (Autónomo)

The moment you switch your contract from "Employee" (W-2) to "Independent Contractor" (1099), the Certificate of Coverage requirement vanishes.

You no longer need to prove the US is covering you. Instead, you simply promise to register as an **Autónomo** (Freelancer) in Spain and pay into the Spanish system (*RETA*).

This scares Americans. They think: *"I don't want to pay Spanish taxes! I want to stay in the US system!"*

Let us look at the math. You might be wrong.

## The "Social Security Arbitrage" (Why it’s Cheaper)

As a US 1099 contractor, you normally pay **15.3% Self-Employment Tax** on your first ~$170,000 of income. That is roughly **$26,000** gone.

However, the US-Spain Totalization Agreement works both ways.

If you are paying into the Spanish Social Security system, **you are EXEMPT from US Self-Employment Tax.**

* **Cost in USA:** ~15.3% of income.
* **Cost in Spain (RETA):** Spain uses a "contribution base" system. In 2026, even on a high income, your monthly social security payment is capped. You will likely pay between **€350 and €600 per month** depending on the base you choose (and new freelancer flat rates).

**The Math:**
* You pay ~$6,000 - $8,000/year to Spain for full healthcare and pension coverage.
* You save ~$20,000+ in US Self-Employment Tax.

**You effectively net $12,000+ per year just by switching systems.**

## The "Beckham Law" Bonus

There is a myth that freelancers cannot get the Beckham Law (the flat 24% tax rate).

**This is false for Digital Nomads.**

Under the Startup Law, holders of the *International Telework Visa* are eligible for the Special Expats Regime (Beckham Law), whether they are employees or self-employed.

So, by switching to Contractor status, you unlock:
1.  **Guaranteed Visa Approval:** No fighting the SSA for a certificate.
2.  **Zero Risk for your Employer:** They have no liability in Spain. You are just a vendor.
3.  **Social Security Savings:** Swap a 15.3% US tax for a capped Spanish fee.
4.  **24% Income Tax:** Flat rate on your invoice earnings.

## The "Protector" Verdict

Stop fighting the bureaucracy. If your HR department is hesitating, offer them the Contractor solution. It solves their compliance headache, and it puts thousands of dollars back in your pocket.

**Speed is safety.** The W-2 path is slow. The Contractor path is fast.
