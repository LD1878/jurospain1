faqs:
  - question: "Why are there never any appointments on the Extranjería website?"
    answer: "Automated scripts (bots) run by 'locutorios' and unscrupulous agencies scan the government website 24/7. They snatch up every appointment slot within milliseconds of release, then resell them on the black market for €50-€100."
  - question: "Is it legal to buy an appointment?"
    answer: "It is a gray area. While paying a third party for 'administrative assistance' is legal, the government is actively cancelling appointments that are suspected to be booked by bots. You risk paying €50 and having your appointment voided at the door."
  - question: "Does JuroSpain need appointments to file my visa?"
    answer: "NO. This is the biggest misconception. As registered attorneys (*Abogados*), we file applications digitally through the **Red Abogacía** professional platform. We do not need a 'Cita Previa' to submit your Digital Nomad Visa or Renewal. We bypass the public queue entirely."
  - question: "What about TIE fingerprinting? Do I need an appointment for that?"
    answer: "Yes, fingerprinting (*Huellas*) requires physical presence. However, JuroSpain has access to specific 'batch' release times and internal notification channels that allow us to secure these slots for clients without resorting to the black market."

It is 9:00 AM on Monday. You are sitting at your computer, refreshing the *Sede Electrónica* page.

*"No hay citas disponibles."* (No appointments available).

You try again at 9:05.
You try again on Tuesday.
You try again for three weeks.

Welcome to the **Cita Previa Mafia.**

In 2026, getting an appointment with the Spanish Immigration Office (*Extranjería*) or National Police has become virtually impossible for the average citizen.

## The Invisible War: You vs. The Bots

You are not competing against other expats. You are competing against code.

Unethical agencies and "Cita Brokers" run sophisticated scripts that ping the government servers thousands of times per second. The moment a slot opens, the bot grabs it.

They then sell these slots on Telegram channels or corner shops for €50, €80, or even €150.

It is a racket. The government knows it. They implement Captchas, they block IPs, but the bots always adapt.

## The Mistake: Thinking You Need an Appointment

Here is the secret the "Mafia" doesn't want you to know:

**For 90% of immigration procedures, the "Appointment" is obsolete.**

If you are applying for:
* The Digital Nomad Visa (Initial Application)
* The Highly Qualified Professional Visa
* Visa Renewals
* Beckham Law Application

**You do NOT need to visit an office.**

At JuroSpain, we do not fight for appointments. We don't refresh websites.

As registered Lawyers (*Colegiados*), we have a digital key that gives us access to the **Professional Registry (Mercurio / Red Abogacía).**

* **You send us PDF documents.**
* **We digitally sign and upload them.**
* **We get the receipt immediately.**

Zero appointments. Zero waiting. Zero bots.

## When You DO Need an Appointment (The TIE Card)

There is one step where you must physically appear: **Fingerprinting** (*Toma de Huellas*) for your TIE card.

You cannot digitize your thumb (yet).

For this, you are stuck in the battle. But even here, there are strategies:
1.  **The "Friday Morning" Rule:** Many provinces release bulk appointments on Fridays between 9:00 AM and 11:00 AM.
2.  **The "Police Station" Pivot:** Don't just look at the main city office. If you live in Madrid, look for appointments in **Alcorcón** or **Pozuelo**. If you live in Barcelona, try **Badalona**. A 20-minute train ride saves you 2 months of waiting.

## The Verdict

Stop refreshing the page.

If you are trying to file your visa papers by hunting for a 'Cita Previa', you are playing a losing game.

Let us use our **Professional Digital Access** to file for you today. The only appointment you should worry about is your dinner reservation to celebrate.
