faqs:
  - question: "Can a freelancer on the Digital Nomad Visa use the Beckham Law?"
    answer: "Yes. As of the 2026 tax regulations, freelancers (autónomos) on the Digital Nomad Visa are eligible for the Beckham Law special tax regime, provided they have not been tax residents in Spain for the previous five years and their work is 80% international."
  - question: "Do I have to pay Spanish Social Security if I am under the Beckham Law?"
    answer: "Yes. Tax residency and Social Security are separate systems. Even if you pay a flat 24% income tax via the Beckham Law, you must still register with the RETA system and pay monthly Social Security quotas based on your net earnings."
  - question: "What is the deadline to apply for the Beckham Law in 2026?"
    answer: "You must submit Form 149 to the Spanish Tax Agency within exactly six months of obtaining your residence permit or starting your activity with Social Security. Missing this deadline results in being taxed at progressive rates up to 47%."

## Understanding the DNV Tax Paradox in 2026

The Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) offers one of the most attractive fiscal setups in Europe, but it contains a "paradox" that confuses many expats. While the **Beckham Law** allows you to be treated as a non-resident for tax purposes (paying a flat 24% rate), the **Social Security system** views you as a full resident worker. Managing these two overlapping systems is the key to financial optimization in 2026.

## The Beckham Law: A 24% Flat Rate for 6 Years

For high earners, the Beckham Law (Special Expatriate Tax Regime) is the primary reason to choose the DNV. In 2026, the benefits remain robust:

* **Flat Income Tax:** 24% on Spanish-source income up to €600,000.
* **Foreign Income Shield:** Your global investments, rental income, and capital gains are generally not taxed by Spain.
* **No Wealth Tax:** You are exempt from the standard Spanish Wealth Tax on global assets, paying only on assets physically located in Spain.
* **No Modelo 720:** You are not required to file the informative declaration of overseas assets.

In our 15 years of handling visa audits, we have seen that the most common failure point is the six-month application window. If you do not file Form 149 in time, you revert to the progressive tax scale, which in 2026 can reach 47% in regions like Valencia or Catalonia.

## The Social Security Requirement: RETA and Quotas

Unlike the Non-Lucrative Visa, the Digital Nomad Visa is a work-authorized permit. This means you must contribute to the Spanish Social Security system. 

For 2026, the government has frozen the **autónomo quotas** at 2025 levels while negotiations continue. This means your monthly contribution is based on your "Rendimientos Netos" (Net Income). 

| Monthly Profit Band | 2026 Monthly Quota | Access to Benefits |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Below €670** | ~€230 | Full Healthcare & Pension |
| **€1,700 to €1,850** | ~€310 | Full Healthcare & Pension |
| **Above €6,000** | ~€530 | Full Healthcare & Pension |

If you are an employee of a foreign company, your employer may be required to register with Spanish Social Security and pay contributions on your behalf, unless a bilateral "Totalization Agreement" exists between Spain and your home country (common for the US, UK, and Canada).

## The "Double Taxation" Myth

A major concern for nomads in 2026 is paying taxes twice. Spain has Double Taxation Treaties with over 90 countries. If you pay Social Security in Spain, those payments are generally deductible from your taxable base. Furthermore, under the Beckham Law, your work is considered "earned in Spain" because you are physically performing it here, meaning you typically only pay income tax to the Spanish Tax Agency, avoiding tax in your home country for that same salary.

## 2026 Tactical Tip: The "Zero Quota" Strategy

If you are a new autónomo on the DNV in 2026, you can combine the **Tarifa Plana** (€80/month Social Security) with the **Beckham Law** (24% tax). In specific regions like Madrid, Andalusia, and the Balearic Islands, you can even apply for the "Cuota Cero," where the regional government refunds your first 12 months of Social Security payments. This effectively gives you a year of residency with zero Social Security cost and a capped tax rate.

## Why You Need a 2026 Tax Simulation

The Beckham Law is not always the best choice. If you earn less than €45,000 per year, the standard progressive tax system (IRPF) might actually result in a lower effective tax rate due to personal allowances and deductions for children or rent, which are **not** available under the Beckham Law. Before applying, you should run a side-by-side simulation to ensure the 24% flat rate is truly working in your favor.

### Can I use the Beckham Law if I have a Spanish client?
Yes, but with limits. To maintain your DNV status and Beckham Law eligibility, no more than 20% of your total income can come from Spanish-based clients or companies.

### Does the Beckham Law cover my spouse's income?
No. The Beckham Law is individual. If your spouse also works and wants the 24% flat rate, they must independently qualify and apply for their own special tax regime status.

### What happens in year 7?
After your sixth year, you automatically transition to the standard Spanish tax resident regime. You will be taxed at progressive rates on your worldwide income and will be required to file Modelo 720 and pay Wealth Tax where applicable.
