faqs:
  - question: "Can I apply for the Digital Nomad Visa on my own for free?"
    answer: "Yes. You can submit the application yourself via the UGE-CE website using your digital certificate. The government fee is roughly €75. However, the 'cost' is often measured in time, rejected documents, and the stress of navigating a legal system in a foreign language."
  - question: "Why is JuroSpain faster than a standard Gestoría?"
    answer: "Most Gestorías are generalists. JuroSpain is a specialist. We know exactly which specific words the UGE-CE looks for in your 'Memoria Descriptiva' and which specific insurance clauses trigger rejections. We don't just file; we pre-validate to ensure a 20-day resolution."
  - question: "Does JuroSpain handle taxes and housing too?"
    answer: "Yes. This is our core advantage. A visa lawyer might get you in, but leave you exposed to a 47% tax bill. JuroSpain integrates your Visa strategy with your Tax strategy (Beckham Law) and Real Estate needs (Padrón/Mortgage) to protect your entire relocation."

It is the first question every expat asks:

*"Why should I pay a lawyer when I can just read Reddit and do it myself?"*

It is a fair question. In 2026, information is everywhere. You can join five different Facebook groups, download a "Free Checklist," and attempt to navigate the Spanish Ministry’s website with Google Translate.

Technically, you can be your own surgeon, too. But we wouldn’t recommend it.

At **JuroSpain**, we have audited hundreds of "DIY" applications that went wrong. The story is always the same: you saved €1,500 on legal fees, but you lost six months of your life and thousands in potential tax savings.

Here is the honest Cost-Benefit Analysis of **The DIY Route** vs. **The JuroSpain Protocol**.

## The Hidden Cost of "Free" (The DIY Trap)

When you choose to do it yourself, you are betting against the house.

The Spanish immigration system is not designed to be user-friendly. It is designed to be rigorous.
* **The "Silence" Risk:** If you make a small error—uploading a document in the wrong format, or translating a criminal record incorrectly—the administration often won't tell you. They will simply sit on your file. Weeks turn into months. You are left in "Administrative Silence," unsure if you are approved or denied.
* **The "Reddit" Advice:** The advice you find on forums is often outdated. "What worked for Dave in 2023" does not work in 2026. The UGE-CE criteria have tightened, specifically regarding Social Security certificates and company letters.
* **The Fragmented Reality:** You might successfully get the visa, only to realize you accidentally disqualified yourself from the Beckham Law tax breaks because of *when* you entered the country.

**The DIY Cost:** €0 in fees + High Stress + High Risk of Rejection + No Tax Strategy.

## The JuroSpain Advantage: Speed is Safety

We don't sell "form filling." We sell **velocity**.

In a bureaucracy that is famous for being slow, **JuroSpain** moves fast.

### 1. The 20-Day Standard
We know the internal criteria of the UGE-CE (Large Business Unit). We don't guess if your documents are correct; we know.
By submitting a "Perfect File"—structured exactly how the civil servants want to see it—we drastically reduce the chance of *requerimientos* (requests for more info).
Our goal is simple: **Approval in 20 working days.**

### 2. The "One-Stop-Shop" Ecosystem
This is where **JuroSpain** separates itself from a standard lawyer.

Most immigration lawyers will get your visa stamped and shake your hand. "Good luck with your taxes," they say.

That is dangerous.
Your visa status, your tax residency, and your housing situation are all connected.
* **JuroSpain** aligns your visa start date to optimize your **Beckham Law** application (saving you up to 24% in taxes).
* **JuroSpain** coordinates your **Padrón** registration so you can get your TIE card immediately.
* **JuroSpain** advises on your **Real Estate** purchase to ensure it doesn't trigger Wealth Tax issues.

We don't just move you to Spain; we set up your life in Spain.

## Comparison: DIY vs. JuroSpain

| Feature | The "DIY" Route | The JuroSpain Protocol |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Success Rate** | ~60% (High risk of errors) | **99%** (Pre-validated files) |
| **Time to Approval** | 3 - 6 Months (Avg) | **~20 Days** (UGE-CE Target) |
| **Tax Strategy** | None (You figure it out) | **Beckham Law Optimization** |
| **Support** | Facebook Groups | **Dedicated Legal Partner** |
| **Stress Level** | Maximum | **Zero** |

## The Verdict

If you have infinite time, fluent Spanish, and a high tolerance for frustration, the DIY route is possible.

But if you are a professional who values your time, your sanity, and your tax efficiency, there is only one choice.

**Don't gamble with your future.**
Choose the speed, safety, and integrated strategy of **JuroSpain**.
