**Status:** *Developing Story (Updated Dec 2025)*

If you are planning to move to Spain in 2026, the price of admission is about to go up. Negotiations are currently underway to raise Spain's **Salario Mínimo Interprofesional (SMI)**, the benchmark figure used to calculate the financial requirement for the Digital Nomad Visa (DNV).

Unions are pushing for a **7.5% increase**, a move that would push the minimum monthly income requirement for a single applicant dangerously close to **€3,000 per month**.

If your income is on the borderline, **you need to act before January 1st.** This guide explains the new projected numbers and the strategy to "lock in" the lower 2025 rate.

## The 2026 Projection: At a Glance

The Spanish Digital Nomad Visa requires you to prove an income of **200% of the SMI**. While the final figure will be published in the Official Gazette (BOE) in late December or January, current negotiations suggest a significant hike.

Here is the projected impact if the 7.5% proposal is accepted:

| Applicant | Current (2025) Requirement | Projected 2026 Requirement* | Increase (Approx) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Main Applicant** | €2,763 / month | **~€2,970 / month** | +€207/mo |
| **Annual Total** | €33,156 / year | **~€35,640 / year** | +€2,484/yr |

*> **Note:** These figures are projections based on the 14-payment SMI calculation used by the UGE. The final numbers may vary slightly but the upward trend is confirmed.*

## Why the SMI Matters for Your Visa

Unlike the Non-Lucrative Visa (which uses the IPREM index), the Digital Nomad Visa is pegged to the **Minimum Wage (SMI)**. The Spanish government raises the SMI almost every year to combat inflation.

* **The Formula:** 200% of SMI (calculated on 14 payments, divided by 12 months).
* **The Reality:** When the government helps local workers by raising the minimum wage, they inadvertently make it harder for international remote workers to qualify for the visa.

## Projected Income Thresholds for Families

If you are moving with a spouse or children, the impact of the 2026 increase compounds.
* **Spouse:** +75% of SMI
* **Child:** +25% of SMI

| Family Size | 2025 Total (Monthly) | 2026 Projected (Monthly) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Applicant + Spouse** | ~€3,799 | **~€4,085** |
| **Family of 3** (1 Child) | ~€4,145 | **~€4,457** |
| **Family of 4** (2 Children) | ~€4,490 | **~€4,829** |

*> **Key Takeaway:** A family of four may soon need to prove nearly **€58,000** in annual gross income to qualify.*

## Strategy: How to Lock in the 2025 Rate

The Immigration Office (UGE) assesses your financial solvency based on the SMI **active at the moment of application**.

This creates a critical window of opportunity:

1.  **Submit Before Jan 1st:** If we submit your application electronically before the clock strikes midnight on New Year's Eve, your file is legally bound to the **2025 SMI**.
2.  **The "Grace Period":** Often, the new SMI is not officially published until mid-January or even February, applied retroactively. However, relying on this administrative lag is risky. The safest route is to file in **December**.

## The Exchange Rate Risk (USD/GBP)

If you earn in **US Dollars** or **British Pounds**, you face a double threat in 2026:
1.  **The Higher Euro Requirement:** The bar is being raised by ~7.5%.
2.  **Currency Fluctuation:** If the Euro strengthens against the Dollar, your income might suddenly drop below the threshold on the day of review.

**Our Advice:** We always recommend a **10% safety buffer** above the minimum requirement. With the 2026 increase, that "safe zone" is moving significantly higher.

## FAQs

**What if I already have my visa? Does this affect renewal?**
No. If you already hold the visa, this increase does not affect you until you apply for your renewal. At renewal time, you will be assessed against the SMI active *in that future year*.

**Is the 7.5% increase confirmed?**
Not yet. It is the proposal from the major unions (CCOO and UGT). Business associations are pushing for a lower rise (approx 3%). The final number will likely land somewhere in between, but **an increase is guaranteed**.

**Does savings count toward this amount?**
Unlike the Non-Lucrative Visa, the DNV is primarily an *income-based* visa. While some case officers accept savings to bridge a small gap, you should not rely on savings to meet the core 200% SMI requirement.

## Do not get priced out of Spain.

If your income is close to the current €2,763 threshold, waiting until 2026 could be a fatal mistake for your application.
