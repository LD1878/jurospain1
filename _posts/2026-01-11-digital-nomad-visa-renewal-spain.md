faqs:
  - question: "When should I start my DNV renewal in Spain?"
    answer: "You can submit your renewal application 60 days before your current TIE expires or up to 90 days after. However, we strongly recommend filing at least 30 days before expiry to avoid issues with digital certificates or bank account access."
  - question: "Does administrative silence mean approval for DNV renewals?"
    answer: "Yes. For Digital Nomad Visa renewals submitted in 2026, the 'Silencio Administrativo Positivo' rule applies. If the UGE-CE does not issue a formal resolution within 20 working days, your renewal is legally considered approved by default."
  - question: "Do I need a new criminal record check for my DNV renewal?"
    answer: "Usually, no. If you have not spent more than six months outside of Spain during your initial residency period, the Spanish authorities generally do not require a fresh criminal record check from your home country for the extension."

## Navigating the 2026 Digital Nomad Visa Renewal (3+2)

The first wave of Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) holders granted in 2023 are now entering their renewal window. In 2026, the process transitions from a three-year initial permit to a two-year extension, eventually leading to permanent residency at the five-year mark. To succeed, you must prove that the professional and financial conditions of your initial approval have been maintained or improved.

## 2026 Income Thresholds for Renewal

The income requirement remains tied to the 200% SMI (Minimum Interprofessional Wage) rule. Because the SMI has risen since 2023, your renewal must reflect the **2026 rates**, not the rates at which you were originally approved.

* **Single Applicant:** ~€2,760 per month.
* **Family Unit (Applicant + 1):** ~€3,795 per month.
* **Additional Dependents:** ~€345 per month per person.

In our 15 years of handling residency audits, we have found that the UGE-CE (Unidad de Grandes Empresas) now prioritizes **bank traceability**. You must provide 12 months of bank statements showing that your salary or freelance payments have consistently arrived from the non-Spanish sources declared in your file.

## The Mandatory 2026 Document Checklist

For a successful 2026 extension, your digital file must include:

1.  **Form MI-T:** The updated 2026 residency renewal form.
2.  **Certificate of Social Security Standing:** You must prove you have no outstanding debts with the *Tesorería General de la Seguridad Social*.
3.  **Hacienda Tax Clearance:** A certificate showing you are up to date with your IRPF (or Beckham Law) filings.
4.  **Updated Employer Letter:** For employees, a fresh letter from your company confirming your role, salary, and permission to continue working from Spain. 
5.  **Freelance Evidence:** For *autónomos*, a summary of your last four quarterly tax filings (Modelo 130 and 303) and current contracts.
6.  **The Padrón Histórico:** A certificate from your town hall proving your continuous residence at your Spanish address.

## What if I Changed Employers?

This is the most critical compliance point for 2026. If you are an employee and you have changed companies since your initial visa was granted, you must have notified the UGE-CE within 30 days of the change. 

If you did not notify them at the time, you cannot simply "renew" with the new company. You may be required to file a fresh initial application. For freelancers, changing clients is not an issue as long as your total income remains above the SMI threshold and no more than 20% of your revenue comes from Spanish entities.

## The 20-Day "Administrative Silence" Rule

The UGE-CE is legally obligated to resolve your renewal within 20 working days. If you do not receive a resolution (favorable or unfavorable) within this window, the rule of **Positive Administrative Silence** applies. This means your application is legally approved. You can then request a "Certificado de Acto Presunto" to book your fingerprint appointment at the police station for your new TIE.

## Maintaining "Continuous Residence" for Citizenship

While the DNV is flexible regarding travel, 2026 renewals are being scrutinized for "Continuous Residence." If your goal is to apply for Spanish citizenship after 10 years (or 2 years for Latin American citizens), you must not have been absent from Spain for more than six months in any single year. We recommend keeping a "Travel Log" of all entries and exits to provide as a backup if the officer questions your physical presence.

### Can I renew if I am currently outside of Spain?
Technically, yes, as the application is submitted digitally via the Mercury platform. However, you must be back in Spain within the 90-day post-approval window to complete your fingerprinting for the physical TIE card.

### Do I need to show my health insurance again?
If you are registered with Spanish Social Security as an employee or *autónomo*, you are covered by the public system. You do not need private insurance for the renewal. If you are an employee on a foreign payroll with an A1/S1 form, you must provide proof that this coverage is still active.

### How much does the renewal cost in 2026?
The government fee (Tasa 790-038) is approximately €80 per applicant. Additionally, the TIE card issuance fee at the police station is approximately €20.
