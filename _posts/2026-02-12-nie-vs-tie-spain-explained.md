"Do I need a NIE or a TIE?" is the most common question asked at Spanish immigration offices. In 2026, the distinction remains critical for everyone from Digital Nomads to retirees. One is a number; the other is a card. Getting them confused can stall your housing contract, your bank account, and your legal residency.

## What is a NIE?

The **NIE (Número de Identidad de Extranjero)** is simply a tax identification number. It is assigned to you for life. 
* It does **not** grant residency.
* It is required to buy a car, open a bank account, pay taxes, or buy property.
* It appears on a white piece of A4 paper.

## What is a TIE?

The **TIE (Tarjeta de Identidad de Extranjero)** is the physical plastic card that proves you are a legal resident.
* It contains your photo, fingerprint, and NIE number.
* It proves your right to live and (if applicable) work in Spain.
* It has an expiration date and must be renewed.

## The Key Differences Table

| Feature | NIE (White Paper) | TIE (Plastic Card) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **What is it?** | A Number | A Residency Card |
| **Function** | Tax identification | Proof of legal stay |
| **Residency?** | No | Yes |
| **Photo?** | No | Yes |
| **Expires?** | The number never expires | Yes, must be renewed |

## Who needs which?

* **Non-Residents:** If you are just buying a house but not living here, you only need a NIE.
* **EU Citizens:** You receive a green "Certificado de Registro," which contains your NIE. You generally do not get a TIE.
* **Non-EU Citizens:** You need both. You usually get the NIE first (or during your visa process) and then must apply for the TIE card within 30 days of arriving in Spain.

## The 2026 Application Process

In 2026, most provinces require a *Cita Previa* (appointment) booked online. 
1. **The Form:** Fill out Form EX-15 (for NIE) or EX-17 (for TIE).
2. **The Fee:** Pay the relevant tax (Modelo 790-012).
3. **The Appointment:** Visit the *Policía Nacional* or *Extranjería* office with your passport, photos, and proof of why you need the document.

## FAQs

**Can I open a bank account with just a NIE?**
Yes, most banks will open a "Non-Resident Account" with just the NIE paper. To switch to a resident account, you will need the TIE.

**Is my NIE the same as my Social Security number?**
No. They are two different systems, though your Social Security record will be linked to your NIE.
