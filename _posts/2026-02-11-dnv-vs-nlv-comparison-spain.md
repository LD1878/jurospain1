Spain remains the top destination for expats in 2026, but the "best" visa depends entirely on one question: **Do you intend to work?** The **Digital Nomad Visa (DNV)** and the **Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV)** are the two most popular pathways, but they serve completely different lifestyles.

## Quick comparison table 2026

| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Primary Goal** | Remote work for foreign clients | Retirement or living on savings |
| **Can you work?** | Yes (Remote + 20% Spanish limit) | **No.** Absolute prohibition of work |
| **Min. Income** | ~€2,850/mo (SMI based) | ~€2,400/mo (IPREM based) |

## Work rights: The dealbreaker

The biggest mistake expats make is applying for an NLV and then working remotely. 
* **NLV:** Specifically forbids *any* lucrative activity. Remote work for a US or UK company is technically a violation and can lead to renewal denial.
* **DNV:** Specifically designed for remote workers. You can be an employee or a freelancer. You can even earn up to 20% of your total income from Spanish clients.

## 2026 Income requirements

In 2026, thresholds have increased due to the latest Minimum Wage (SMI) and IPREM adjustments.

### Digital Nomad Visa (DNV)
The DNV is linked to the SMI. 
* **Main Applicant:** 200% of SMI = **€2,850/month**.
* **Family:** +75% for spouse; +25% per child.

### Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV)
The NLV is linked to the IPREM.
* **Main Applicant:** 400% of IPREM = **~€2,400/month**.
* **Family:** +100% of IPREM per dependent (~€600).

## Tax benefits: Beckham Law vs IRPF

The DNV offers a major fiscal advantage for high earners:
* **DNV Holders:** Can apply for the **Beckham Law**, a flat tax of **24%** on Spanish income.
* **NLV Holders:** Are treated as standard tax residents. You pay progressive rates on your **worldwide** income once you spend 183 days in Spain.

## Application: Inside Spain vs Consulate

* **DNV:** You can enter Spain as a tourist and apply directly for a **3-year permit**.
* **NLV:** You **must** apply at the Spanish consulate in your home country for a 1-year entry visa.

## FAQs

**Can I switch from DNV to NLV?**
No. You cannot modify from DNV to NLV while inside Spain. You would usually have to return to your home country to start a new application.

**Does the DNV allow me to work for a Spanish company?**
Only up to 20% of your total income. If you get a full-time Spanish job, you must modify your visa.
