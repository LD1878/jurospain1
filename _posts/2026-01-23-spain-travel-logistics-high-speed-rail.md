faqs:
  - question: "How early must I arrive for a high-speed train in Spain?"
    answer: "Unlike the UK or Germany, Spanish high-speed stations (Atocha, Sants) have mandatory security checkpoints. You must scan your luggage before accessing the platform. We recommend arriving 30 to 40 minutes before departure. Boarding gates ('Control de Acceso') strictly close 2 minutes before the scheduled time. If you are late, the train will leave without you."
  - question: "What is the 'Resident Discount' for air and sea travel?"
    answer: "If you are a registered resident (empadronado) in the Balearic Islands, Canary Islands, or Ceuta/Melilla, you are legally entitled to a 75% subsidy on travel to the mainland. This applies to flights and ferries. You must present your 'Certificado de Viajes' (obtainable from the Town Hall) during check-in if the airline's automatic verification system fails."
  - question: "Why does the Renfe website reject my foreign card?"
    answer: "The state operator's payment gateway often flags non-Spanish BIN codes as fraud. To bypass this technical hurdle, we advise clients to pay via PayPal on the official site or use a third-party aggregator like Trainline or Omio. While aggregators charge a small service fee, they guarantee the transaction clears instantly."

## The Liberalization of Spanish Rail: A Market Analysis

In the past, moving between Madrid, Barcelona, Valencia, and Seville meant one option: Renfe. Since the liberalization of the railway infrastructure (*Adif*), the market has split into three distinct competitors. Understanding the difference is vital for cost efficiency and comfort.

**1. Renfe (The Incumbent):**
* **The Product:** Operates the premium "AVE" and the low-cost "Avlo."
* **The Verdict:** Reliability is high, but the pricing is often the most expensive. Their "Compromiso de Puntualidad" (Punctuality Commitment) is the best in the sector: if an AVE train is delayed by more than 15 minutes, you are often entitled to a 50% refund.

**2. Ouigo (The Low-Cost Disrupter):**
* **The Product:** A subsidiary of French SNCF. Uses double-decker trains.
* **The Warning:** This is the "Ryanair" of trains. The base ticket is cheap (€9-€19), but luggage is strictly policed. If your bag exceeds the dimensions of a cabin case, you will pay a significant penalty at the gate. There is no Wi-Fi on the basic tier.

**3. Iryo (The Premium Competitor):**
* **The Product:** A consortium involving Italian Trenitalia.
* **The Verdict:** Currently the "Best in Class" for business professionals. Even their basic fare often includes flexible changes. The trains are newer, quieter, and the onboard gastronomy (Haizea) is superior to the pre-packaged sandwiches found on competitors.

## How to Navigate Station Logistics

Spanish transport hubs like **Madrid Atocha** or **Barcelona Sants** operate more like airports than traditional train stations.

**The Security Protocol:**
Upon arrival, you cannot walk directly to the track. You must pass through a luggage scanner. Note that liquids are permitted: you do not need to empty water bottles. However, laptops often need to be removed from bags.

**The "Sala Club" Benefit:**
If you purchase a "Premium" or "Infinite" ticket with Renfe or Iryo, you gain access to the VIP Lounges (*Sala Club*). These offer free beverages, snacks, and high-speed Wi-Fi. For business travelers, the price difference between a standard and premium ticket is often less than the cost of lunch and coffee in the main terminal.

## Strategic Air Travel: The "Puente Aéreo"

For the Madrid-Barcelona corridor, the train has largely replaced the plane. However, the "Puente Aéreo" (Air Shuttle) remains a critical tool for urgent travel.

**How it Works:**
Iberia operates a dedicated terminal space for these flights. You can arrive at the airport 20 minutes before departure, pass through a dedicated "Fast Track," and board. Tickets are open-ended: if you miss the 09:00 flight, you are automatically rolled over to the 10:00 flight without penalty. This flexibility is unmatched by rail operators.

**Airport Transfers:**
* **Madrid (Barajas):** Use the C-1 or C-10 Cercanías train from Terminal 4. It costs €2.60 and reaches the city center in 25 minutes.
* **Barcelona (El Prat):** The Aerobús is efficient but costs nearly €7.00. A taxi has a minimum surcharge. The metro (L9 Sud) is useful only if you are going to the Fira Gran Via area; it is slow for the city center.
