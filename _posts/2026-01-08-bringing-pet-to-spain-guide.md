faqs:
  - question: "Do I need insurance for my dog in Spain?"
    answer: "Yes. As of the latest 2025 and 2026 regulatory updates, all dog owners in Spain must maintain valid third-party civil liability insurance. This applies regardless of the dog's breed or size and must cover the pet for its entire life."
  - question: "Can I bring my pet to Spain without a rabies vaccine?"
    answer: "No. All dogs, cats, and ferrets entering Spain must be vaccinated against rabies. The vaccine must be administered at least 21 days before travel and only after the animal has been fitted with an ISO-compliant microchip."
  - question: "How many pets can I bring to Spain at once?"
    answer: "You can bring up to five pets under the non-commercial relocation rules. If you have more than five, the move is classified as a commercial import, which requires different health certificates and potentially higher customs fees."

## What are the requirements for moving pets to Spain in 2026?

To bring a pet to Spain in 2026, you must provide proof of an ISO-compliant microchip, a valid rabies vaccination administered at least 21 days prior to travel, and a government-endorsed health certificate. Additionally, all dog owners must now secure civil liability insurance and register their pets with the regional animal database upon arrival.

## The Essential Health Protocol: Microchips and Vaccines

The order of operations is critical. If you do not follow this specific sequence, your pet may be denied entry or placed in quarantine at your expense.

1.  **Microchip First:** Your pet must have an ISO 11784/11785 compliant 15-digit microchip.
2.  **Rabies Vaccination Second:** The vaccine must be administered on or after the date the microchip was implanted.
3.  **The 21-Day Wait:** You cannot enter Spain until at least 21 days have passed since the primary rabies vaccination.
4.  **Titre Tests:** If you are traveling from a "high-risk" country (non-listed third countries), a rabies neutralizing antibody titration test is required three months before travel.

## Documentation: The 10-Day Window

For expats moving from the USA, UK, or other non-EU countries, the timing of your paperwork is high-stakes. You must obtain an Animal Health Certificate (AHC) or the EU equivalent from an authorized veterinarian.

In our 15 years of handling visa audits and relocation logistics, we have seen that the most common failure point is the endorsement window. The certificate must be signed by your government's official veterinary body (such as the USDA in the US or APHA in the UK) within 10 days of your arrival at the Spanish border.

## New 2026 Animal Welfare Laws in Spain

Spain's legal landscape for pet owners changed significantly with the full implementation of the Animal Welfare Law. Expats must be aware of these three strict regulations:

* **Mandatory Civil Liability Insurance:** Every dog, from a Chihuahua to a Great Dane, must be covered by third-party liability insurance. This is no longer restricted to "dangerous breeds."
* **Time Limits on Solitude:** It is illegal to leave a dog alone for more than 24 hours. For cats and other pets, the limit is three days.
* **Prohibited Areas:** Pets cannot be left unattended on balconies, terraces, or inside parked vehicles. Fines for these infractions can exceed €10,000.

## Potentially Dangerous Dogs (PPP) and Licensing

If your dog belongs to a breed classified as "Potentially Dangerous" (PPP), such as a Pit Bull Terrier, Rottweiler, or Doberman, you face additional hurdles. You must apply for a specific municipal license within your first month in Spain. This requires a criminal record check, a psychological aptitude test, and a higher level of insurance coverage. These dogs must also wear a muzzle and remain on a short lead in all public spaces.

## Registering Your Pet Locally (REIAC)

Your foreign microchip is not automatically linked to the Spanish system. Once you arrive and have your NIE or residency card, you must visit a local veterinarian to register your pet in the regional database (such as AIAC in Catalonia or RAIA in Andalusia). This ensures that if your pet is lost, they can be identified and returned to you via the national REIAC network.

### Does Spain require a pet quarantine?
No. As long as your pet meets all the microchip, vaccine, and health certificate requirements, there is no mandatory quarantine period.

### Can my pet fly in the cabin?
This depends entirely on the airline and the weight of your pet. Generally, pets under 8kg (including their carrier) may fly in the cabin on most European carriers like Iberia. Larger pets must travel in the climate-controlled cargo hold.

### What should I do if my pet's microchip is not ISO-compliant?
You should have your vet implant a second, ISO-compliant chip. Both chip numbers must be clearly recorded on the health certificate and vaccination records to avoid confusion at customs.
