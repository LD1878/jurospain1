faqs:
  - question: "How strictly is the 'No Work' condition enforced in 2026?"
    answer: "Extremely strictly. Since the introduction of the Digital Nomad Visa, Consulates now scrutinize NLV applicants for 'hidden' remote work. If your bank statements show regular transfers from a corporate entity you own, the Consulate may reject the application on the grounds that you are 'economically active.' You must prove that income is passive (dividends) or that you have severed employment ties."
  - question: "What is the specific financial requirement (IPREM) for 2026?"
    answer: "For 2026, the IPREM (Public Income Indicator of Multiple Effects) has been adjusted. You must prove 400% of the IPREM for the main applicant, plus 100% for each dependent. Ideally, we advise clients to demonstrate at least €32,000 annually for a single applicant, though holding €60,000+ in liquid savings significantly strengthens the 'solvency' argument during the audit."
  - question: "Can I invest in Spanish companies while on this visa?"
    answer: "Yes, provided your role is strictly that of a shareholder. You can own 100% of a Spanish SL (Limited Company), but you cannot be the 'Sole Administrator' receiving a salary for daily management. You must appoint a local manager or administrator to handle operations. Your income must come solely from dividends, which are considered passive."
  - question: "How does private health insurance underwriting affect the application?"
    answer: "The Consulate requires a policy with 'Complete Coverage' and 'No Copayments' (Sin Copago). The biggest hurdle in 2026 is for applicants over 65 or those with pre-existing conditions. If you are denied coverage by Spanish insurers, you cannot obtain the visa. We recommend securing the policy binding letter (Certificado de Cobertura) before booking your visa appointment."

## Executive Summary: The "Residency by Solvency" Model

The Non-Lucrative Visa (NLV) is a residence authorization that grants non-EU citizens the right to reside in Spain without engaging in labor or professional activities. In 2026, it remains the preferred vehicle for retirees, sabbaticals, and high-net-worth families who do not need to work to sustain their lifestyle.

However, the application process is no longer a simple checklist. It is a legal audit of your financial independence. The following sections outline the procedural "How To" for each compliance vertical.

## How to Structure Your Financial Dossier

The Spanish Foreigners' Office (*Extranjería*) does not look for "wealth" in the abstract; they look for **liquidity** and **recurrence**.

**The Procedural Step:**
Do not simply print a bank balance summary. You must construct a narrative of availability.
1.  **Segregate Funds:** Move the required savings (minimum €30,000+) into a dedicated account three months prior to application. This prevents the funds from appearing "transient."
2.  **Certify the Source:** If relying on savings, provide a Notarized Affidavit explaining the origin (e.g., sale of property, inheritance).
3.  **Certify the Flow:** If relying on passive income (pension, dividends), obtain a bank certificate that explicitly states the funds are "available for immediate withdrawal" and "free of liens."

**Legal Warning:**
Cryptocurrency portfolios are rarely accepted as primary proof of solvency in 2026 due to volatility. These assets should be liquidated into fiat currency or used only as supplementary evidence.

## How to Clear the Criminal & Medical Checks

Bureaucracy fails on the details. Two specific documents cause 40% of initial rejections due to formatting errors.

**1. The Criminal Record Certificate (ACRO/FBI):**
* **How To:** Request a background check from every country where you have resided for the past 5 years.
* **The Critical Detail:** The document is valid for only **90 days**. Do not request this too early. It must be Apostilled (Hague Convention) and translated by a Sworn Translator (*Traductor Jurado*). A standard translation will be rejected.

**2. The Medical Certificate:**
* **How To:** Your doctor must sign a letter stating you are free of "diseases that may have serious public health repercussions in accordance with the International Health Regulations of 2005."
* **The Critical Detail:** If this specific phrase (IHR 2005) is missing, the Consulate will reject the medical certificate immediately.

## How to Navigate the Consular Interview

The interview is a "credibility assessment." The officer is determining if you secretly intend to work in Spain.

**The Strategy:**
Prepare a **Letter of Intent**. This formal document should outline:
* Your reasons for choosing Spain (culture, climate, education).
* Your explicit confirmation that you understand the prohibition on working.
* Your housing plan (e.g., "We have a signed rental contract in Alicante").

If asked about your profession, answer in the past tense ("I *was* a software engineer, I have now ceased operations"). Any ambiguity about "checking emails" or "consulting" can lead to a re-classification to the Digital Nomad Visa, restarting your process.
