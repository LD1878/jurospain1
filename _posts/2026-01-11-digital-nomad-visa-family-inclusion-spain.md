## Moving to Spain as a Remote-Working Family in 2026

The Digital Nomad Visa (DNV) is currently the most flexible family residency permit in Spain. Unlike the Non-Lucrative Visa, which prohibits all work, the DNV allows the main applicant to work remotely while granting their spouse or partner full access to the Spanish labor market. This "dual-income" potential makes it the premier choice for professional couples relocating in 2026.

## 2026 Income Thresholds for Dependents

As of 2026, the income requirements are indexed to the updated Minimum Interprofessional Wage (SMI). To ensure your family application is successful, you must prove you meet these specific monthly thresholds:

* **Main Applicant:** €2,760 per month (200% of SMI).
* **First Dependent (Spouse/Partner):** +€1,035 per month (75% of SMI).
* **Each Additional Dependent (Children/Parents):** +€345 per month (25% of SMI).

In our 15 years of handling visa audits, we have seen that the "currency buffer" is vital. If your salary is paid in USD or GBP, the Spanish authorities require a 10% safety margin over these euro figures to protect against exchange rate volatility on the day your file is reviewed.

## Spousal Work Rights: The "Invisible Benefit"

One of the most frequent questions we receive is whether a spouse can take a job in a local Spanish office. The answer is a definitive yes. Once the family residency is granted, the spouse receives a TIE (residence card) that includes the remark "Autoriza a Trabajar." 

This allows the spouse to:
1.  Register as an **Autónomo** to start a local business.
2.  Be hired by a **Spanish company** with a standard employment contract.
3.  Continue their own **remote work** for a foreign entity.

## Documenting the "Family Unit" in 2026

To include family members, you must provide legal proof of the relationship. In 2026, the "UGE-CE" (Unidad de Grandes Empresas) is stricter regarding the age and legalization of these documents:

* **Marriage/Civil Union Certificates:** These must be issued within the 90 days prior to your application and must bear the Hague Apostille.
* **Birth Certificates:** Required for all children. Note that dependent adult children (over 18) can only be included if they are single and you can prove they are financially dependent on you (e.g., university enrollment or living at home).
* **Sworn Translations:** All certificates must be translated into Spanish by a translator authorized by the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MAEC).

## Schooling and Local Integration

Once your family arrives in Spain on the DNV, you have 30 days to begin the "Empadronamiento" process. This town hall registration is the key to enrolling your children in the local school system. 

In 2026, Spain has expanded its "Bilingual Education" programs in regions like Madrid and Andalusia. This allows your children to integrate into the Spanish culture while maintaining their English language skills. Having the DNV also grants your family access to the Spanish public healthcare system once you begin your Social Security contributions, providing a comprehensive safety net for your move.

### Can I add family members later, or must we apply together?
You can do either. You can apply as a family unit from the start or the main applicant can move first and "regroup" the family later. However, applying together is generally more efficient and ensures the entire family receives their 3-year residency cards at the same time.

### Do children need a clean criminal record check?
Only dependents over the age of 18 are required to provide a criminal record certificate. These must be obtained from every country where they have lived for the past five years and must be apostilled and translated.

### What happens if I lose my remote job?
You must notify the immigration authorities. However, if your spouse has secured a local Spanish job, you may be able to modify your residency status to remain in the country as a dependent of your spouse’s work permit.
