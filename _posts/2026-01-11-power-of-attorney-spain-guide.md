faqs:
  - question: "Can I use a digital signature for a Spanish Power of Attorney?"
    answer: "As of 2026, Spanish notaries still require a physical, 'wet-ink' signature for a Power of Attorney related to property deeds or residency applications. Digital signatures like DocuSign are generally not accepted for these formal public documents."
  - question: "How long is a Spanish Power of Attorney valid?"
    answer: "Unless an expiry date is specifically written into the document, a Spanish Power of Attorney is valid indefinitely until the principal dies or formally revokes it before a notary. We recommend adding a 12-month sunset clause for security."
  - question: "Do I need an apostille for a POA signed at a Spanish consulate?"
    answer: "No. If you sign your Power of Attorney at a Spanish Consulate abroad, it is treated as a domestic Spanish document and does not require a Hague Apostille or a sworn translation."

## What is a Power of Attorney (POA) in Spain?

A Power of Attorney, known in Spain as a *Poder Notarial*, is a legal document that allows a third party to act on your behalf. In 2026, this is the essential tool for expats who need to buy property, open bank accounts, or submit residency files without being physically present in Spain. Without a correctly drafted POA, your legal representative cannot sign the *Escritura* (Title Deed) or manage your tax obligations.

## 2026 POA Types: Special vs. General Powers

Choosing the right scope is critical for risk management. In our 15 years of handling visa audits and property closings, we categorize these into two main types:

* **Special Power (Poder Especial):** This is the most secure option. It grants authority for a single, specific task, such as "Purchasing the property at Calle Mar 15, Málaga." It expires once the task is complete.
* **General Power (Poder General):** Often called a "Poder Apocalíptico" due to its broad reach, this allows your attorney to do almost anything in your name, including withdrawing funds or selling assets. We rarely recommend this for clients unless they have a lifelong relationship with their representative.

## Signing Abroad: The Consulate vs. Local Notary Route

If you cannot travel to Spain, you have two distinct paths for 2026. Each has significant logistical trade-offs:

### The Consulate Route (The "Gold Standard")
You sign the document directly at the Spanish Consulate in your home country.
* **Pro:** The document is already in Spanish and drafted to Spanish standards. No apostille or translation is needed.
* **Con:** Appointment wait times in 2026 can exceed 8 weeks in busy hubs like London, New York, or Manchester.

### The Local Notary + Apostille Route (The "Speed" Route)
You sign a bilingual document before a local notary in your home city.
* **Pro:** You can usually get an appointment within 48 hours.
* **Con:** The document **must** be legalised with a Hague Apostille and often requires a sworn translation by a MAEC-registered translator in Spain. This adds an extra layer of cost and a 5-to-10 day delay for the apostille courier.

## Mandatory Clauses for 2026 Property and Residency

A generic Power of Attorney from your home country will likely be rejected by a Spanish notary. To ensure your 2026 POA is "fit for purpose," it must include:

1.  **The NIE Clause:** Explicitly authorizing the attorney to apply for and collect your Foreigner Identity Number.
2.  **The Tax Clause:** Granting the right to file Modelo 600 (Property Transfer Tax) or Modelo 210 (Non-Resident Income Tax).
3.  **The "Self-Contracting" Clause (Autocontratación):** This is vital if your lawyer is also acting for another party in the transaction. Without this clause, the notary may block the signing due to a conflict of interest.
4.  **Bank Account Management:** Permission to open, but not necessarily withdraw from, Spanish bank accounts for the purpose of utility bill setup.

## Managing Security and Revocation

In 2026, you must treat a Power of Attorney with the same security as a digital password. If you need to cancel the authority, you cannot simply send an email. You must sign a **Revocation of Power** (*Revocación de Poder*) before a notary. 

Once signed, your lawyer must physically notify the previous attorney. For high-value transactions, we suggest including a "Joint Signature" clause, requiring two different people to sign together to validate any asset sale. This creates a built-in "two-factor authentication" for your Spanish legal affairs.

## The Hague Apostille: A 2026 Necessity

For any POA signed outside a Spanish Consulate, the Hague Apostille is non-negotiable. This is a stamped certificate attached to your document that verifies the notary’s signature is legitimate for international use. In 2026, many countries have moved to "e-Apostilles," but you must ensure the Spanish Land Registry in your specific region accepts the digital version, as some still require the physical paper seal.

### Can my spouse and I sign one joint Power of Attorney?
Yes. If you are buying a property together, you can both appear on a single POA document to authorize the same representative. This reduces your notary and apostille costs by half.

### What is a "Copia Autorizada"?
When you sign a POA, the notary keeps the original and gives you a *Copia Autorizada* (Authorized Copy). This is the only version that has legal weight in Spain. A simple photocopy or PDF scan is not sufficient for signing a property deed.

### Does a POA cover my healthcare decisions?
A standard financial POA does not. If you wish to grant someone the power to make medical decisions, you must sign a specific "Preventative Power of Attorney" or a Living Will (*Testamento Vital*).
