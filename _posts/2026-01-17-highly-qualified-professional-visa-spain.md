faqs:
  - question: "How long does the HQP Visa take to get approved in 2026?"
    answer: "By law, the UGE-CE (Large Business Unit) must resolve applications within 20 working days. If they fail to respond, the visa is technically approved by 'Administrative Silence' (positive), though we always push for the formal resolution."
  - question: "Can I apply for the HQP visa without a university degree?"
    answer: "Technically, yes, by proving 3 years of specialist experience. However, at JuroSpain, we advise against this route if speed is your priority. Proving 'experience' is subjective and prone to delays. A formal degree is a binary check: fast and safe."
  - question: "Can I bring my family with the Highly Qualified Professional visa?"
    answer: "Yes. In fact, it is the best visa for families. You can file jointly, and your spouse gets full work authorization immediately upon approval. No waiting periods."
  - question: "Does this visa qualify me for the Beckham Law?"
    answer: "Yes. The HQP visa is one of the primary qualifiers for the Special Expats Tax Regime (Beckham Law), allowing you to pay a flat 24% tax rate up to €600,000."

Spain has a reputation for bureaucracy. It is often well-earned.

If you browse the forums, you will read horror stories of standard work permits sitting in a pile at the *Extranjería* for four, five, or six months.

**You do not have six months.**

You have a job offer. You have a start date. You have a hiring manager who is excited today but might be annoyed in three months.

This is why, for elite talent moving to Spain in 2026, there is only one viable option: **The Highly Qualified Professional (HQP) Permit.**

It is the only immigration process in Spain designed to move at the speed of business.

## The "20-Day" Promise

The HQP visa does not go through the standard provincial immigration offices. It goes directly to the **UGE-CE (Unit of Large Companies and Strategic Collectives)** in Madrid.

This unit operates with a distinct mandate: efficiency.

By law, they have **20 working days** to resolve your application. This is not an estimate. It is a statutory deadline. In the chaotic landscape of 2026 immigration, this predictability is the most valuable asset you can buy.

## The Price of Admission: Your University Degree

Speed requires clarity. The UGE-CE moves fast because they deal with objective criteria.

There is often confusion about whether you can apply with "experience" instead of a degree. Let us be transparent with you.

While the law *allows* for 3 years of professional experience to substitute a degree, **we treat this as a last resort.**

Why? Because "experience" is subjective. It requires letters, CV audits, and interpretation by a civil servant. Interpretation takes time. Interpretation leads to requests for additional documents (*requerimientos*).

A **University Degree** is binary. You have it, or you do not.
When we submit a recognized degree from a top-tier university alongside your contract, we are giving the UGE-CE a "green light" file. They can stamp it and move on.

If you want the 20-day resolution, bring the degree.

## The Hidden Risk: The "Role Mismatch"

Here is where sophisticated applicants fail.

You have a degree in "Mechanical Engineering." Your job title is "Product Manager."

To a human, this makes sense. To a rigid bureaucratic system, this looks like a discrepancy.

If the UGE-CE cannot draw a straight line between your academic background and your specific job functions, they will pause the clock.

**This is where JuroSpain protects you.**

We do not just upload your PDF contract. We work with you (and your HR department) to structure the **Memoria Descriptiva** (Job Description Memorandum). We ensure the language used in your application creates an undeniable link between your academic credentials and your daily responsibilities.

We translate your "tech" reality into their "legal" necessity.

## Speed is Safety

In 2026, the market moves too fast for "mañana."

The Highly Qualified Professional visa is the most powerful tool in the Spanish immigration arsenal. It grants you:
1.  **Residency for 3 years** (renewable).
2.  **Immediate family inclusion** (spouse works day one).
3.  **A direct path to the Beckham Law** (24% flat tax).

But mostly, it grants you **certainty**.

Don't let a slow visa kill a fast career move.
