## 2025-11-24 — Repository hygiene

- Committed generated `Gemfile.lock` to stabilise GitHub Pages dependency resolution.
- Added `/.gitignore` to ignore `_site/` (generated site) and other common temporary files.

These are small hygiene changes to make builds reliable and avoid committing generated files.
